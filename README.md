# Mike Gleicher's GitHub "home repo"

The actual pages will be built by Hugo from another repo. 

The Master branch has nothing in it (except for this README - and a copy of the CNAME and .nojekyll files).

The hugo continuous integration (from the HugoHome repo) pushes things to the gh_pages repo. Make sure it includes the CNAME and .nojekyll as well!
