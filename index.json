I will not provide these letters.\nI will provide letters for students that I get to know outside of regular classes. For example, if you are involved in a directed study project or work with me as a peer mentor for a class (that\u0026rsquo;s why it says \u0026ldquo;as a student\u0026rdquo;).\nIn the past I offered to provide a generic \u0026ldquo;Did well in class letter\u0026rdquo;. I will not do this anymore (for reasons described below). I will not provide reference letters for students that I know only through a class (as a student). It is unfair for me to write letters for just some of the students in class (see below), so I need to have this as a blanket policy.\nIncluded in this: I will not provide reference letters for admissions into the CS 2nd Masters program for students who only know me through a class. The reasons are slightly different, although the fairness arguments below do apply. With this, since I know the committee, I know that they are looking for evidence beyond just \u0026ldquo;student can get a decent grade in the class.\u0026rdquo;\nYes, I know this is a problem for many of our students: you only meet professors in large classes, and you want a professor to write a letter for you. See Undergrad Research, Projects and Directed Studies for some thoughts on this.\nRationale - Why I stopped providing DWIC letters With our large classes, I do not have the opportunity to get to know students well enough to write letters. Yes, there are a few students that I get to know - but it is unfair to everyone else for me to provide letters only to those students. While sometimes I get to know a few students in a large class, this isn\u0026rsquo;t a good measure of which students are good. Usually, the few I get to know are either (1) end up working with me beyond class anyway, (2) lucky to have a situation where I got to know them, (2) problem cases (in which case I often don\u0026rsquo;t remember the good work - only the problems they had), (3) intentionally trying to be noticed to get a letter, or (4) I don\u0026rsquo;t actually remember them correctly and am relying on my own faulty memory.\n A story \u0026hellip; I got a request from a student in a mid-sized grad class (CS765 with about 60 people). All I could remember was that he came to class late which was disruptive. Of course, my memory is skewed (see the literature on cognitive biases) - it could be that it was just a few times that stuck in my head. I certainly didn\u0026rsquo;t remember his projects (there were lots of people who got As - I cannot remember all of them). And even when he clogged my mailbox with a copy of his project he was so proud of, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the context of other projects to remember why it was so great, and I really couldn\u0026rsquo;t re-grade it.\n The generic did well in class letter probably doesn\u0026rsquo;t help your application. How would you, as an admissions person feel if you read something like:\n (Student) was a student in my CS559 Computer Graphics class in Spring of 2020. According to my unofficial records they received an A, however, you should check their official transcript for their actual grade. CS559 is a challenging class, so earning an A probably means they learned something about the topic and are able to demonstrate some level of programming and mathematical skill. This may be a predictor of their ability to perform well in similar classes. However, I have no direct memory of the student\u0026rsquo;s work or specific knowledge of their abilities.\n Even if all I do is provide this generic letter, it is still a lot of work for me. I need to:\n Keep track of all the requests. Deal with students asking about the requests. Deal with issues where things are not handled correctly (lost emails, broken web links, etc.) Remember which ones have been done or not (since requests get sent multiple times)  And then, even the act of sending a reference letter is not a simple act of just sending a letter. Each reference requires dealing with some web service, each one with different requirements.\nIncreasingly, the burden of simply uploading a letter is becoming prohibitive. Even though a DWIC letter won\u0026rsquo;t help your application, providing it requires:\n Dealing with an uploading website that inevitably asks me to fill out lots of forms. Having to answer questions that I cannot answer (about how good a student you are). Managing passwords and other account information. Keeping track of which requests I\u0026rsquo;ve already done (since inevitably, they ask multiple times). Entering the same information multiple times (for each different program) Dealing with \u0026ldquo;verification procedures\u0026rdquo; - where they have to verify that it is really me sending the reference. (not many places do this - but the fact that some are starting leads me to believe it will be a trend)  "},{"uri":"/lunr-search/","title":"","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Search Results Waiting for search script to run...   /** * Call a function on window.onload * - calls any previous function that was there * - by placing it in a function, the old function can be easily stored in closure */ function onWindowOnload(newFunction) { let oldFunction = window.onload; window.onload = function(ev) { // technically, window.onload is an event handler and can expect that // \"this\" is the window, so we have to use apply if (oldFunction) oldFunction.apply(window,ev); newFunction(); }; } onWindowOnload(function() { const query = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search); const searchString = query.get('q'); const target = document.getElementById('#app'); // helpers to avoid using innerHTML (which may be unsafe) function addText(node,text) { let textNode = document.createTextNode(text); node.appendChild(textNode); return node; } function addSearchString(node,text) { let searchSpan = document.createElement(\"span\"); searchSpan.classList.add(\"search__string\"); searchSpan.appendChild(document.createTextNode(text)); addText(node,' \"'); node.appendChild(searchSpan); addText(node,'\" '); } function addAndAppendPar(etype=\"P\",parclass=null) { let node = document.createElement(etype); if (parclass) { node.classList.add(parclass) } target.appendChild(node); return node; } // clear out the DIV target.innerHTML = \"\"; // an initial message while we load and build... let message = addAndAppendPar(\"P\",\"search__message\"); addText(message,\"Searching for string\"); addSearchString(message,searchString); addText(message,\" ...

A lot of students seem to be interested in doing \u0026ldquo;research\u0026rdquo; these days, and I\u0026rsquo;d like to set the expectations correctly.\nShort version: (1) understand research vs. projects; (2) don\u0026rsquo;t do research / directed study until you\u0026rsquo;ve done the requisite coursework; (3) I will say no if you are not a Wisconsin student; (4) consider things to build your portfolio on your own.\nWarning: This is a work in progress, but I am letting out since people are asking. \nCOVID-19 Update (January 3, 2020): It is unclear how many undergrad projects I can work with given the remote working situation. It turns out that working remotely is surprisingly challenging for supervising and mentoring students.\nThere are REU (NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates) opportunities, which require students to be U.S. citizens or permanent residents. If you contact me, please be clear if you qualify.\nMy initial experience with working with undergraduates remotely has not been as successful as I would have liked. I am trying to think about how to improve the process, but I probably will not take on new (non-REU) students until I have a plan to make it work better.\nWarning, this is a disorganized stream of thoughts\u0026hellip; But the answer to your question is probably hidden in here.\nAnd, you may want to see my The Graduate School FAQ\nUndergraduate Research? Research is about creating new things. How can you create new things if you don\u0026rsquo;t understand the foundations and what exists? You need to know what to build off of, and you need to know what exists (otherwise, how do you know that what you are doing is new?).\nAn advantage to a \u0026ldquo;research project\u0026rdquo; is that it involves follow through: it isn\u0026rsquo;t enough to just do something, you must understand it, document it, put it in the context of what else is known, make sure it is really correct, \u0026hellip; Projects done for others often have these properties.\nIt is possible for undergrads to be involved in research, even without a lot of experience. The key word is \u0026ldquo;involved\u0026rdquo; - because research is a team sport. You may not have the experience to provide context - someone else can provide that; but that means you must have a different role on the team.\nProjects vs. Research Not all cool projects are \u0026ldquo;research\u0026rdquo;. Often, you make something which isn\u0026rsquo;t necessary creating new knowledge but is creating something interesting. Sometimes this might be \u0026ldquo;development\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;engineering\u0026rdquo;, but sometimes it is just learning.\nThe biggest difference is the goal. The goal of research is to create new knowledge. The goal of a project might be to create new knowledge (in which case it is a research project), but there might be some other goal. A goal might be to learn something, or to get experience, or to make something useful, or\u0026hellip;\nNote that the coursework at the university is directed study it is not necessarily \u0026ldquo;research.\u0026rdquo;\nIf you are an undergrad, you probably want to do a project - you want the experience to learn from, and to show that you have had project experience. If you create new knowledge (or help a team create new knowledge) that\u0026rsquo;s a bonus. A more realistic goal might be to prepare yourself to work on longer term research someday.\nWhy do a Project / Research? Make sure you know why you want to do this, not just take a class.\nA few (good) answers:\n It\u0026rsquo;s a way to learn about something you cannot learn about in class. It\u0026rsquo;s a way to apply what you\u0026rsquo;ve learned to make something bigger. It\u0026rsquo;s a chance to experience having to work in a more project-oriented (self-directed, open-ended) way. It\u0026rsquo;s a chance to get more real practice with the skills you are trying to pick up. It\u0026rsquo;s a way to get really deep into something that you are really interesting in / passionate about. It\u0026rsquo;s a way to get experience working with people who are also passionate about these topics. (Yes, there is irony that independent projects are a good way to work with others).  There are many more good answers. Less good answers include \u0026ldquo;I want to learn something that I could have learned in a class in a different setting\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t want to learn in the structured environment of a class.\u0026rdquo;\nIf your answer is \u0026ldquo;because it will help me get into grad school\u0026rdquo; - be careful, since the next question is \u0026ldquo;why do you want to go to grad school?\u0026rdquo; (which gets back to the answers above).\nWhat kinds of projects? If you\u0026rsquo;re really interested in graphics, robotics, visualization, \u0026hellip;, you may not need someone to give you a project. While some guidance can be useful, there is a lot to be said for taking the initiative to learn about the things that most interest you. Have a passion project: it will drive you farther and better.\nThink about things that build your portfolio. I often ask people \u0026ldquo;what\u0026rsquo;s the coolest thing you\u0026rsquo;ve made\u0026rdquo;. An animation, game, website, or something that you made because you were excited about it and driven by your own curiosity and interests is more likely to interesting than a \u0026ldquo;I did what a professor asked me to do\u0026rdquo; answer. (Nothing against doing projects for Professors - since they often show your ability to work with people, to take direction, \u0026hellip;) Passion projects not only show your skill but they also show your initiative and ability to solve problems independently and \u0026hellip;\nIf you aren\u0026rsquo;t driven by curiosity and interests, then you might want to question yourself as to why you want to work on a project.\nDo I need to do a project with a Professor? There are advantages to doing a project in a formal setting. It is good to show that you can work well when supervised. That you can solve problems that someone else gives you (otherwise, you might just pick easy things). To have someone who can force you to follow through\u0026hellip;\nThat said: there is a lot to be said for doing a project on your own or with your friends.\nIt is good to show that you have enough interest and drive to do something. That you can work independently. That you have enough creativity and self-direction to do something without a Professor telling you what to do.\nIdeally, in your undergrad career you will have a mix. Some hobby/passion projects where you do something you really care about and are interested in as a way to develop your interests and skills. And some project where you work in a supervised setting that shows you can do hard things, work with others, and follow things through to completion.\nFor example, if you are interested in graphics\u0026hellip; make a game; make an animation; make an interactive VR experience; make some cool art; etc. Doing this will kindle your interest in the field, give you an opportunity to broaden and sharpen your skill set, give you a portfolio of accomplishments, \u0026hellip; Plus, you can make something cool.\n(I\u0026rsquo;ll say it again) If you aren\u0026rsquo;t driven by curiosity and interests, then you might want to question yourself as to why you want to work on a project.\nCan I do a project with you? I supervise a decent number of undergraduate projects (some of which are legitimately research). However, I am limited in how many I can supervise. Supervising a project takes time and effort from me (and usually from one of the graduate students who works with me as well).\nIt is my job (as a Professor) to educate students - mentoring students doing projects is one way I do that.\nTo be blunt, supervising undergrad projects isn\u0026rsquo;t an efficient use of my time. I can lecture to an undergrad class and educate many students are a time (I\u0026rsquo;ve taught computer graphics to close to 200). So, if I am going to do it, I have to have some other incentive. Usually, this means that the project needs to be something I am interested in, and need some help getting done.\nTherefore, with a project, there is usually something you are already able to do that we build on.\nAlso, I probably do not have enough time myself to adequately mentor and supervise you. Therefore, if we work together, I will have some other person (a graduate student or post-doc) involved to help me mentor you.\nUndergrad Research in Other Fields In many other fields, there is pressure / incentive to get \u0026ldquo;younger\u0026rdquo; students involved in \u0026ldquo;research\u0026rdquo; right away. A lot of the reasons don\u0026rsquo;t apply to computer science:\n  In CS, there is less you can do without training. In other fields, there are often tasks that you can do with limited skills. For example, in a biology / chemistry lab you can always wash test tubes.\n  In CS, we aren\u0026rsquo;t so desperate for students to do menial labor. In a biology / chemistry lab, they are often looking for cheap test tube washers.\n  In CS, there are plenty of \u0026ldquo;personal projects\u0026rdquo; you can do to develop your skills and explore your interests. You can make stuff yourself. This is much harder to do in other fields.\n  In CS, there is tons of cool and interesting stuff to do that is \u0026ldquo;making stuff\u0026rdquo; - good projects that aren\u0026rsquo;t necessarily research.\n  Why can\u0026rsquo;t I be a volunteer? I usually do not work with people who are volunteers. There are exceptions, but these are usually not for new people starting out.\nWhen I pay someone (either with credit or money), both sides are accountable. There is a formalization of the commitment. I am promising to provide enough mentoring/support that you can do things to get the pay. You are committing to doing enough to receive the pay. I find with volunteers, it is too easy for me (and other mentors) to ignore you.\nMany students (see \u0026ldquo;If you are not a Wisconsin student\u0026rdquo;) say they are \u0026ldquo;self-supported\u0026rdquo;. This might cover the financial aspects. However, there is a significant cost to having a person work with us. The biggest resource bottleneck is our time: we only have so much time/energy to devote to mentoring project students. There are also other costs both financially (resources like computing and lab space) and conceptually (like the opportunity to do other things).\nBut I need to have some contact with a Professor\u0026hellip; Having a directed study experience is probably good for you (see above).\nIf you want to go to do something after graduation (graduate school, a good job, \u0026hellip;), project experience is really valuable since it provides a different set of skills (the ability to be self-directed yet work as part of a team, \u0026hellip;).\nThe blunt thing: if all you do is take classes, if you need reference letters (for graduate school or a job), (at best) all you can get is a \u0026ldquo;did well in class\u0026rdquo; (DWIC) letter. This is probably not good enough for what you want. Especially since at Wisconsin, our undergraduate classes are so large, and grades alone don\u0026rsquo;t tell us much (especially in these big classes). See Reference Letters for Students in Classes\nSo, I understand your pain: you need to demonstrate your abilities to someone so they can be a reference, but with so many students in a similar situation, we can\u0026rsquo;t do this for everyone.\nWhat can you do? Some thoughts:\n Take the appropriate classes. Make sure you have the solid and formal background. Take classes with me. I tend to prefer students who have been through a class with me (it\u0026rsquo;s not a requirement). It means that you know me, and I know you at least a little. Plus, my classes are usually relevant. Have some project experience that shows your skills and interests. You personal hobby project is possibly more relevant than good grades in a bunch of classes. It shows you have enough interest to do something on your own, and often involves relevant skills. Knowing how to do 3D modeling, Do things to explore your interests. The fact that you take initiative to learn about your interests shows that you really are interested. Build your portfolio, and present it well. Having a nice web page that shows off your projects is often more useful than a resume listing that you took standard courses.  Some thoughts on pursuing graphics/robotics/vr/vis related topics on your own:\n  Learn art tools. You will need to be able to use tools to make stuff, even if your focus is on building your own software. Learn to use a 3D modeling program (Blender or Maya). Learn to make web pages since you\u0026rsquo;ll want to show off anything you make (I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to use static web page generators). Learn to edit video, \u0026hellip; Lots of the best software is available to students for free. You aren\u0026rsquo;t going to be taught these things in a class, but they are really useful skills.\n  Learn libraries/frameworks/engines.\n Unity Game Engine (or Unreal) Being able to work with a game engine (we tend to use Unity since its easier to get started with) is a great way to do 3D projects. A lot of things we do in research we like to do in a game engine. It\u0026rsquo;s the best way to make VR experiences. Vue.js (or React.js) Any non-trivial web project will probably use a framework. We use Vue in our group, but it is not as common as React. D3.js (or Vega Lite) This is a useful JS library for making visualizations. ROS (the Robot Operating System)    Become a better programmer. Practice building complex stuff. Become more fluent with the tools. (every day I learn a new feature in Visual Studio Code). Try seeing if you can use the debugger to trace through some code you found on the web. Pick up a new programming language (If you\u0026rsquo;re not a Python expert, you should be. Several people have been telling me the joy of programming is Rust. \u0026hellip;)\n  With any of these things: don\u0026rsquo;t just learn the thing for its own sake. Pick something to do with it and try to do it. Make something. This can both motivate your learning as well as force you to develop some follow through. Make a game or interactive experience, or an animation, or website, or\u0026hellip;\nIf you are not a Wisconsin student\u0026hellip; I cannot host visiting \u0026ldquo;interns\u0026rdquo; - in order to work with me on an undergraduate project you must be an enrolled Wisconsin student. Limited exceptions might be possible for students who either were recently Wisconsin students (e.g., after you graduate) or going to be Wisconsin students (e.g., about to matriculate). And, in really unusual cases, there are REU opportunities.\nFrom time to time, I may have funding to support \u0026ldquo;Research Experiences for Undergraduates\u0026rdquo; (REUs) - the funding that supports this only applies to students who are (1) U.S. citizens (or permanent residents) and (2) enrolled at a U.S. University. This is one case where I can work with someone who is not a Wisconsin student.\n"},{"uri":"/researchtheme/authoring/","title":"Video, Animation and Image Authoring","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Our goal is to make it easier for people to create useable images and video.

A brief biography will tell you how I got here. You can see a reasonably current CV, but you probably are looking for select publications, or a more complete list of papers, Mike Gleicher's Talks, or videos in data order. I\u0026rsquo;l try to keep a list of project descriptions.\nOn this page: BAD LINK, BAD LINK, BAD LINK.\nThis fall I will teach CS559 Computer Graphics.\nI do External (Ph.D. Minor) Advising. If you need this, please come by my office hours - but check the guidebook rules first.I am not on UGAC anymore, so I cannot officially do undergraduate advising.\nYou might be interested in my grad school FAQ. Come and talk to me if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in computer graphics or related topics.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in joining our group, come talk to me! If you aren\u0026rsquo;t a student at Wisconsin yet, please look at my grad school FAQ, particularly the last few questions.\nSome things that I am working on these days Abstracting Molecular Surfaces and MotionThe shapes and motions of large molecules (Proteins) are very important, but very complicated. We are trying to find concise ways to describe them to make it easier to look at them visually, as well as to analyze them automatically. This includes novel visualization and collaboration tools, as well as automatic matching tools that work directly on the shape and physical property distributions. Example projects: Molecular Surface Abstraction, Surface Descriptors, Depicting Molecular Flexibility, Multi-User Molecular Visualization  Molecular Motion with Aaron Bryden and George PhillipsWe are trying to build better tools for understand the flexibility and motion of protein molecules. We're using coarse-grained models (e.g. normal mode analysis) and finding new ways to make these analyses useful.Example Projects: Static depiction of motion, Normal Mode Explorer Visualizing ComparisonsIncreasingly, visualization needs to help people make comparisons between things in increasingly large data sets. In the past, visualization has focused on helping with particular types of objects: volumes, graphs, molecules, etc. In contast, the Visual Comparisons project tries to understand the general principles that apply no matter what is being compared. We are working with several domain collaborators to explore case studies of comparison to inform the general principles. Current domain collaborations include Educational Science (comparing epistemic frames), Genetics (comparing whole genome alignments), Structural biology (protein shapes and motions), Literary Scholarship (statistical analysis of text corpora), and Virology (understanding virus evolution). We also collaborate with perception experts to better understand the mechanisms in interpreting images. Example Projects: Splatterplots, Tagged Text Collections, Whole Genome Sequence Overviews, Comparing Epistemic Frames, Visualizing Virus Evolution, Explaining High-Dimensional Groups  Re-thinking Photography and VideographyDigital photography (and videography) has changed the world: it is easy (and cheap) to take lots of pictures and video, to share them with others, and to change them. This means its easy to get lots of bad pictures: good pictures (and video) still takes work. Our goal is to make it easier for people to have useable images and video. For example, we have developed methods for improving pictures and video as a post-process (e.g. removing shadows and stabilizing video). We have also worked on adapting imagery for use in new settings (e.g. image and video retargeting or automatic video editing) and making use of large image collections (e.g. intestingness detection or panorama finding). In the future, we hope to put these elements together to make systems that help people make effective use of large collections of images and videos. Example projects: Warp-Based Video Stabilization, Re-Cinematography, 3D Stabilization, Image and Video Retargeting, Panorama finding  Multimedia Database Usage with Feng LiuWe are developing ways to make use of collections of images and videos - both personal collections, as well as large internet databases. For example, we have created tools for finding panoramic images in YouTube collections.Example Projects: Video frame interest, Panorama finding Animating Communicative CharactersWe are working on better ways to synthesize human motions to make animated characters (both on screen and robots) that are better able to communicate. Generally, we focus on trying to make use of collections of examples (such as motion capture) to build models that allow us to generate novel movements, or to define models of communicative motions.Example Projects: Simulating Gaze Behaviors, Parametric Motion Controllers Other StuffI have a bad case of Academic Attention Defecit Disorder, so I am always interested in other things - especially if they involve pictures, geometry, or motion.  Teaching In the Fall, I teach CS559 Computer Graphics. You can find the web pages for the versions in 2009,2008,2007,2006,2005, and if you\u0026rsquo;re really curious, even older versions of the course page are still on the Graphics Group Courses Page.\nIn the Spring, I teach some more advanced course. In Spring 2010 I will teach CS679 Computer Games Technologies (see the 2008 or 2007 versions of the class). In the Spring of 2009, I taught an Advanced Graphics class. In the past, I taught CS777 Computer Animation (2006,2004,2003,and . I am not sure when (or if) this class will be taught again.\nYou can find other information on graphics group classes on the Graphics Group Courses Page.\nRecent Papers I try to keep the complete list available here.

It is an adaptation of the 2011 Reading List. It is substantively the same, however, some of the broader suggestions are made concrete. (it might seem like new topics were added, but they actually are all mentioned on the old list - it\u0026rsquo;s just that now we\u0026rsquo;re being specific about what we mean by things like ``differential geometry.'')\nThis list still has carry over issues from the old reading lists, so if a paper references is difficult to identify, you might go back to the 2004 Qual Reading List.\nThis list should be considered temporary and specific to the Fall 2013 Qual\n1.@ New for 2013: The Modern Paper In addition to the standard reading list of core topics, the qualifying exam includes a short (1 for 2013) list of modern papers. Students are expected to understand this paper, including the background required (e.g. by looking through its reading list). The goal of this section of the qual is less to see that the student understands the specifics of this one paper, but rather, that they are capable of interpreting a modern paper including traversing its background.\nThe paper will be assigned no later than 4 weeks prior to the examination date.\nThe Paper for Spring 2017 is:\nEnglert, P., Vien, N.

([Project Page](http://maverick.inria.fr/Publications/2008/OBWBTS08/))  2.@ Foundations: Graphics Texts Students are expected to have mastery of the topics covered in anintroductory graphics course. The introductory graphics course isCS559, and its recent syllabus should be used as a guide. Note thatsome topics may only covered in passing in the class, but arestill considered important for the Qualifying Exam. For some topics, we expect more depth than the intro class may provide.\nThe textbooks for CS559 (both required and recommended) are suggestedas the core references for the Qualifying Exam. The editions listedare current as of the writing of this list, but students should seekthe most current text available. Chapter numbers refer to the versionslisted.\n[FCG] Shirley, Marschner, et. al. Foundations of Computer Graphics, 3e. AK Peters Publisher, 2009.\nNote: While this is the primary text for 559, the book lacks depth in many of the topics (and makes some key omissions, such as surfaces). The topics of the book serve as the list of what things should be considered as the core of graphics (modulo a few things mentioned).  [RTR] Akienne-Moller, Haines, and Hoffman. Real-Time Rendering, 3e. AK Peters Publisher, 2009.\nNote: While this book is an excellent reference for the key ideas in many areas of graphics, it has incredible detail in areas less relevant to the qual.  [OGL] Shreiner, et al. OpenGL Programming Guide, 7e. Addison Wesley, 2009.\nNote: the OpenGL book is suggested as a reference for the concepts embodied in OpenGL, and because OpenGL is a seminal system that students should be aware of. The specifics of OpenGL (such as the syntax) are not part of the Qualifier material. The basic architecture of OpenGL and its shading model are part of the required material.  2.1@ Topics from Foundations of Computer Graphics In the order they appear in [FCG] - note that [FCG] is not always the preferred resource for the topic.\n Mathematical Basics [FCG 2,5]: Linear Algebra (including the SVD), interpolation Raster Imaging [FCG 3]: The content of this chapter of FCG is really just a preliminary sketch of things that come later. Ray Tracing [FCG 4,13]: the basic ideas are important, the ray/primitive intersection methods are not. (see the realistic rendering section below) Transformations, Viewing [FCG 6,7][RTR 4]: FCG misses some important things like Quaternions (covered in RTR). RTR also includes the basics of other important ideas like morphing and vertex blending (although, other readings may enhance those). Jehee Lee\u0026rsquo;s survey of the issues in rotations (below) is required for concepts like Quaternions and rotation vectors. The \u0026ldquo;Traditional\u0026rdquo; Graphics Pipeline [FCG 2,8] [RTR2]: This includes basic rasterization algorithms, clipping, and anti-aliasing. Image and Signal Processing [FCG 9]: Lighting (local shading models) [FCG 10] [OGL] [RTR]:The OpenGL bookdescribes the model well, but the syntactic details of using it withinOpenGL are an ugly legacy that is not required. Stylized shading is another seperate topic. Texturing [FCG 11][RTR 6]: RTR is the key resource here, includingsampling issues and strategies, and tricks for using texturing to achieve other means. Data Structures / Acceleration Algorithms [FCG 12] [RTR 14]: [FCG12] is a hodgepodge of basic stuff that everyone should know. [RTR 14] has too much detail, but replaces the Visibility section of the old qual reading list Curves and Surfaces [FCG 15][RTR 13]: [FCG] completely omits surfaces. The topic (especially subdivision and meshes) deserves more than what RTR provides (more readings below), but its a good start. Animation [FCG16]: Covers the basics (which might not appear in the more detailed papers below). Programmable Graphics Hardware [FCG 18][RTR 3][OGL 15]:While this is amoving target, the key ideas of the pipeline seem to have settled overthe past few years. Students should understand the idea behind ashading language (like GLSL) as a reflection of the computationalmodel, but the syntactic details of particular languages are unimportant. Interactive Architectures [FCG19]: The chapter has a lot of stuff that\u0026rsquo;s way too basic, but students should understand event models vs. polling and MVC. Color [FCG21]: Students should understand both the perceptual foundations (presented, in an albeit obtuse way in FCG), as well as more practical issues Visual Perception [FCG22]: The FCG chapter is a good starting point. Tone Reproduction [FCG23]: Clearly a case where the basic issues and ideas are more important than the details. Global Illumination [FCG 24] [RTR 9]: The basic concepts are important, but the methods are not well described in either text (and not important). See the Photorealistic Rendering section below. The hacks described in RTR for achieving global illumination effection within the standard rendering pipeline (like 40 pages of shadow mapping tricks) are not essential for the qual, except for the way they bring in the issues of what kinds of effects are difficult to achieve with various rendering approaches. Visualization [FCG27,28]: In the future, this will be an entire section of the qual. For now, what is here serves as a good introduction.  2.2@ Topics from Real-Time Rendering Topics in RTR that are only mentioned briefly in FCG, but stillrequired. These are places where the text is the best starting point (as opposed to the older Qual reading list where we recommended the original source papers for the concepts). Topics where additional papers are needed are discussed in subsequent sections:\n  Transformations [RTR4] - A lot of basic animation concepts (skinning, morphing) are hidden here.\n  Visual Appearance [RTR5] - RTR organizes a lot of material scattered aboutFCG in one place. (gamma, anti-aliasing, compositing, \u0026hellip;)\n  Rendering [RTR7, RTR8, RTR9] - The three chapters of RTR that cover \u0026ldquo;lighting and shading\u0026rdquo; give enough of the basic concepts of rendering. They generally are sufficient (see the rendering section below for a few exceptions). The discussions of \u0026ldquo;real-time hacks\u0026rdquo; can be skipped.\n Chapter 7 - Gives more details on the physics than necessary, but the intuitions are useful for understanding the more essential material. The concepts of surface appearance (like \u0026ldquo;what is the BRDF\u0026rdquo;) are essential, the specific surface models given are not. Chapter 8 - The details of geometric lighting are less important than the idea of image-based lighting (using environment maps), including spherical harmonics. Chapter 9 gives a good overview of global lighting, including introducing the light-path calculus (which is extremely important). The specific \u0026ldquo;hack algorithms\u0026rdquo; for faking global illumination in real-time rendering are not important for the qual (9.1.X, 9.2.5, 9.3 and 9.4 can be skipped).    Non-Photorealistic Shading [RTR11] - a good introduction to the basics that should be augmented with the important papers below\n  Polygonal Techniques [RTR12] - a good coverage of the basics that sufficiently replaces various sections of the older qual list.\n  Surfaces [RTR13] - provides the basics of parametric surfaces and subdivision.\n  3.@ Other Topics These are topics where reading beyond the texts is required.\n3.1@ Differential Geometry and Surface Parameterization Differential Geometry is an important foundation for much of graphics. Students must have a sense of the basic concepts (curvature, distortion, \u0026hellip;). Parts of #1 and #2 below should provide sufficient background.\nOtherwise for a good primer, see the notes (and slides) from the SIGGRAPH Discrete Differential Geometry course (particularly Lecture 2). For further details refer to the resources listed at The 2009 Advanced Graphics Course Readings.\nSurface parameterization is a useful tool for many graphics applications and a setting for applying differential geometry concepts. Students should be aware of the key issues in surface parameterizations, and have some sense of the kinds of approaches available. Suggested readings (any one should be enough):\n Floater, M., \u0026amp; Hormann, K. (2005). Surface Parameterization: a Tutorial and Survey. In N. A. Dodgson, M. S. Floater, \u0026amp; M. A. Sabin (Eds.), Advances in Multiresolution for Geometric Modelling (pp. 157@186). Berlin/Heidelberg: Springer-Verlag. doi:10.1007/b138117 (author copy) - a very widely cited survey, with a nice introduction and tutorial to differential geometry that gets too mathematical too fast. Floater, Sheffer, and others. Mesh Parameterization SIGGRAPH Course (offered in 2008 and 2007), notes online. The Differential Geometry primer is useful not only as a tutorial on differential geometry, but also on the basic issues in parameterization. Sheffer, A., Praun, E., \u0026amp; Rose, K. (2006). Mesh Parameterization Methods and Their Applications. Foundations and Trends@ in Computer Graphics and Vision, 2(2), 105@171. doi:10.1561/0600000011 (author version) - also a nice survey that covers many of the techniques. Provides an excellent survey of the applications of parameterizations and the methods for doing it - with a little less background on the issues.  3.2@ Computational Geometry Students should have an awareness of the basic problems and strategies. Details of algorithms are not required. Specifically, students should know about:\n convex hulls triangulations, with focus on Delaunay triangulations Voronoi diagrams Polygon triangulation  Any basic text should suffice, however recommendations include:\n de Berg, van Keveld, Overmars and Schwarzkopf. ``Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications, 2e.'' Springer, 1998. O\u0026rsquo;Rourke. Computational Geometry in C. Cambridge, 1998. (web page)  3.3@ Image-Based Rendering Modern IBR is covered in RTR. These seminal papers are mainly for historical perspective.\n [McMillan:1995:PMA] Plenoptic Modeling. (a more rigorous variant of Quicktime VR [Chen:1995:QVI] - which is still interesting because of its commercial success). Levoy:1996:LFR Light Field Rendering  3.4@ Image Warping The first paper is important because it is so seminal and gets at the issues in warping and morphing. The second is important as an example of a kind of method:\n [Beier:1992:FIM] Beier, T., \u0026amp; Neely, S. (1992). Feature-based image metamorphosis. ACM SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics, 26(2), 35@42. doi:10.1145/142920.134003. This paper (and the method it introduces) is important because it is the first highly successful warping technique. What differentiates it from what came before is that it is designed to be useful by artists. Igarashi, T., Moscovich, T., \u0026amp; Hughes, J. F. (2005). As-rigid-as-possible shape manipulation. ACM Transactions on Graphics, 24(3), 1134. doi:10.1145/1073204.1073323 - a basic optimization-based warping technique that inspired many later methods.  3.5@ Modeling and Shape Representation Students should have a familiarity with the major methods forrepresenting shape (surfaces and solids) in ComputerGraphics. Familiarity with polygon models, parametric surfaces (Bezierpatches, B-Splines, NURBS), subdivision surfaces, point setrepresentations, constructive solid geometry and implicit surfaces isimportant. Students should have the basic concepts of each, andunderstand the tradeoffs to know where each is appropriate.\nThe core readings generally cover these topics (mainly RTR13).\nThese topics are generally covered in the core. The readings augment this:\n Subdivision surfaces: [DeRose:1998:SSI] Practical issues (and motivation) for Subdivision surfaces (a seminal paper for its motivating aspects). (this augments RTR13) Smoothing: RTR12 is sufficient. Understanding Taubin\u0026rsquo;s early work (e.g. the \u0026ldquo;Taubin smoothing method\u0026rdquo;) is important for the intuitions. Simplification: Chapter 12 of RTR is probably sufficient, but the original sources are good but optional ([Garland:2005:QSD] is a newer reference than the original 1997 SIGGRAPH paper, it has the advantage of giving some perspective on the technique; [Hoppe:1996:PM] Progressive Meshes: The first technique for continuous level of detail, is also an optional seminal paper) Free-Form Deformations: It seems obvious now, but it was an important idea at the time. The paper is seminal. [Sederberg:1986:FDO] Free Form Deformations. Implicit representations, Level Sets, and Signed Distance Fields: you should know what these are and why they are important. (Chapter 16 of FCG covers the main points, but Section 6.2 \u0026ldquo;Level Sets\u0026rdquo; of Bridson\u0026rsquo;s Fluid Course Notes (or text) is recommended to Level sets).  3.6@ Photorealistic Rendering The basic ideas of rendering (which are really about lights and surfaces, not necessarily the algorithms) are sufficiently covered by the RTR chapters described above. At least until there is a real rendering course. FCG sufficiently covers ray tracing.\nTwo key concepts that might deserve more reading:\n The light-path calculus, and the need for radiance caching is introduced in RTR9. The original paper [Heckbert:1990:ART]]] gives more explanation to these critical ideas. Photon map techniques are important as they give a practical way to implement radiance caching, and make the central issues clear. The seminal paper [Jensen:1995:PMI] gives far more than the basic intuitions required for the qual.  Note: for rendering, it is important to understand the properties of lighting, and what different kinds of effects different types of renderers can and cannot achieve. The specific details of rendering algorithms are not required.\n3.7@ Stylized Rendering The core readings discuss a variety of the basic styles, and should be a first starting point (especially for things like silhouettes and toon shading). Impressionist or painting-based styles are included for historical significance.\n Gooch shading is important, but is in the core readings Suggestive Contours, DeCarlo et al. SIGGRAPH 2003. Image Abstraction (DeCarlo and Santenella, SIGGRAPH 2002)  3.8@ Human Figure Animation  Inverse Kinematics: core reading [FCG 16] has basics. Knowing the basic approaches to how IK is done (e.g. numerical, closed-form, example-based), and the core issues in IK is essential. Skinning: basics covered in core, but [Mohr:2003:SBE] Skinning by example is still important - less for the methods, but more for its discussion of basic skinning techniques and their good and bad points. Harmonic Coordinates [Joshi] is important because it introduces Cage-Based Skinning. Animation by Example (motion capture): still looking for a good survey that covers the basic issues and gets at the modern \u0026ldquo;Synthesis-By-Example\u0026rdquo; approaches. For now, the papers from the old list are good for getting at the issues: Retargeting Motion to New Characters Gleicher:1998:RMT] (but ignore the actual spacetime methods), Motion Graphs [Kovar:2002:MG], and Registration Curves [Kovar:2003:RC].  3.9@ Seminal Systems Students should have enough of a sense of the history of the field, and be aware of some key systems and why they are significant. While the exact details of these systems are not important, an appreciation for why they were important is. (this list is greatly reduced)\n Sutherland:1963:SAM] Sketchpad. Cook:1987:TRI] Renderman and Reyes Renderers. Chen:1995:QVI] Quicktime VR  3.10@ Rotations Lee\u0026rsquo;s article is a good place to learn the key concepts.\n Lee, J. (2008). Representing Rotations and Orientations in Geometric Computing. IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, 28(2), 75@83. doi:10.1109/MCG.2008.37  3.11@ Laplacian Editing Approaches Approaches that use optimization to create smooth changes to complex objects are successful in image processing, mesh editing, motion processing, and other things.

Ray Tracing [FCG 4,13]: the basic ideas are important, the ray/primitive intersection methods are not. (see the realistic rendering section below) Transformations, Viewing [FCG 6,7][RTR 4]: FCG misses some important things like Quaternions (covered in RTR). RTR also includes the basics of other important ideas like morphing and vertex blending (although, other readings may enhance those).

Stylized shading is another seperate topic. Texturing [FCG 11][RTR 6]: RTR is the key resource here, includingsampling issues and strategies, and tricks for using texturing to achieve other means. Data Structures / Acceleration Algorithms [FCG 12] [RTR 14]: [FCG12] is a hodgepodge of basic stuff that everyone should know. [RTR 14] has too much detail, but replaces the Visibility section of the old qual reading list Curves and Surfaces [FCG 15][RTR 13]: [FCG] completely omits surfaces.

Programmable Graphics Hardware [FCG 18][RTR 3][OGL 15]:While this is amoving target, the key ideas of the pipeline seem to have settled overthe past few years. Students should understand the idea behind ashading language (like GLSL) as a reflection of the computationalmodel, but the syntactic details of particular languages are unimportant. Interactive Architectures [FCG19]: The chapter has a lot of stuff that\u0026rsquo;s way too basic, but students should understand event models vs. polling and MVC. Color [FCG21]: Students should understand both the perceptual foundations (presented, in an albeit obtuse way in FCG), as well as more practical issues Visual Perception [FCG22]: The FCG chapter is a good starting point. Tone Reproduction [FCG23]: Clearly a case where the basic issues and ideas are more important than the details. Global Illumination [FCG 24] [RTR 9]: The basic concepts are important, but the methods are not well described in either text (and not important). See the Photorealistic Rendering section below. The hacks described in RTR for achieving global illumination effection within the standard rendering pipeline (like 40 pages of shadow mapping tricks) are not essential for the qual, except for the way they bring in the issues of what kinds of effects are difficult to achieve with various rendering approaches. Visualization [FCG27,28]: In the future, this will be an entire section of the qual. For now, what is here serves as a good introduction.

I could have sworn I\u0026rsquo;ve written it down before, but here it goes again.\nNote that some of what\u0026rsquo;s here is just general advice on how to write any paper / proceed on any project. Its just that since a dissertation is bigger, it becomes more important to do these things.\nAlso: this is my opinion. My opinion might matter to you (if you want me to sign off). But you also need to make the other members of your committee happy.\nUpdate 8/8/2008: Added \u0026ldquo;Expected Contributions\u0026rdquo; Discussion\n1. Terminology Thesis vs. Dissertation While the terms \u0026ldquo;thesis\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;dissertation\u0026rdquo; are used interchangeably they really differ in meaning in an important ways. Over time, colloquial usage is making common usage equivalent, but I think the difference is important, so even if the words aren\u0026rsquo;t used this way nowadays, the concept is good to get into your mind:\n A dissertation is a long document discussing a topic. To quote a dictionary: a treatise advancing a new point of view resulting from research; usually a requirement for an advanced academic degree A thesis is a statement to be defended (see What is a Thesis? below). To quote a dictionary: an unproved statement put forward as a premise in an argument  To get a Ph.D. you need to write a dissertation (a long document). That document should (or must, to get me to sign) present a thesis sufficiently well that your committee decides you deserve a Ph. D.\nHere at Wisconsin, there is a milestone we call the prelim (short for preliminary exam). At CMU we called this a \u0026ldquo;thesis proposal.\u0026rdquo; I like the latter terms as it really explains what is going on. I use the terms somewhat interchangeably.\n2. Now on to the real advice First, read Olin Shivers' advice:\n http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/shivers/diss-advice.html  It is my opinion that in order to get a Ph. D. you need to write a dissertation that presents a thesis. My opinion might matter to you: I won\u0026rsquo;t sign off as a committee member unless I am convinced you have done this.\nTo me, the reason you do a Ph. D. dissertation is to prove to your committee that you are able to do a coherent, significant, and independent piece of research work, and therefore are worthy of the \u0026ldquo;credential\u0026rdquo; of a Ph. D.\nPresenting your work as a thesis is an effective way to present it in order to make that proof. Specifically, I don\u0026rsquo;t think your Ph. D. dissertation should be \u0026ldquo;I did a lot of hard work for 5 years, let me out.\u0026rdquo;\n3. What is a Thesis A thesis is a statement to be defended. One you can state your thesis, then it is clear what you need to do: show that it is true or false. And show that it is a \u0026ldquo;good enough\u0026rdquo; thesis to warrant giving you a Ph. D.\nYour thesis should be stateable in a sentence that begins \u0026ldquo;It is my thesis that\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;In this dissertation I will show that.\u0026rdquo;\nIn proper scientific writing, you should say it:\n It is the thesis of this dissertation that X.\n I need to be able to find that sentence in your introduction (in both your prelim and your dissertation).\nA thesis must be a statement that can be true or false, and must be shown to be one or the other. How much work you did is not an issue. So this is a thesis:\n It is my thesis that the sun will rise tomorrow morning.\n This is not a thesis:\n In this document, I will explore planetary motion and describe a set of experiments that illustrate important properties such as sunrise.\n 4. What makes it a Ph.D. Thesis In order to make a dissertation, you need to have a thesis that is \u0026ldquo;good enough\u0026rdquo; so that if you defend it, you deserve to be called \u0026ldquo;Doctor.\u0026rdquo;\nHere are the properties I think it must have:\n It must be a thesis - it might be true or false. It must be novel. Whether its true or false is/was not known to be true before your work. Demonstrating the thesis adds to the world\u0026rsquo;s knowledge. That is, it can\u0026rsquo;t be obviously true or false, and no one could have shown it before. (this latter reason is why you need to do a related work section) It must be important - the world will be a better place if we know that your thesis is true of false. (for this reason, you will need to have a motivation section in your document) It must be provable/testable. When you\u0026rsquo;re done, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a way to prove that you\u0026rsquo;ve actually shown the thesis to be true/false. It must take \u0026ldquo;significant work\u0026rdquo; in order to prove it. We don\u0026rsquo;t want to give a Ph. D. to anyone :-)  A good Ph. D. Thesis has those 5 properties (thesis, novel, important, provable, significant).\nYour dissertation is a document that does 3 things:\n It states a thesis It shows that its a good thesis It shows that the thesis is true or false. Generally, this is the majority of the thesis.  It might do other things, like give background so that the reader can understand #3.\nHaving a thesis is critical because it defines (operationally) when you are done: if you can prove (or disprove) your thesis, then you\u0026rsquo;ve done enough work.\n4.1 Contributions Your thesis must make a contribution (or multiple contributions) to the field of computer science. You should be explicit about what these contributions are (there should be a list summary in the intro, and they should be reviewed at the end). In the prelim, you should be explicit about what you expect the contributions to be.\nNot everything you do will be a contribution. In fact, it is unlikely that the artifacts that you produce (e.g. the software you write) will be a contribution. Its work you do to support/document/prove the contribution, but usually not a contribution unto itself.\n5. The Prelim The \u0026ldquo;Preliminary Exam\u0026rdquo; is a right of passage. At most departments there is something like this (at CMU we called it a \u0026ldquo;thesis proposal\u0026rdquo;).\nBasically, the idea of a prelim is that you will explain what you will do for a dissertation, so the committee can decide whether this will earn you a Ph. D. or not. Its about setting expectations.\nYou can view the prelim as kindof a contract: If you do the work you propose and write it up correctly in a dissertation, then the committee will sign off. They can\u0026rsquo;t (or shouldn\u0026rsquo;t) to say \u0026ldquo;sorry that\u0026rsquo;s not enough.\u0026ldquo;The prelim sets up sufficient conditions for you being finished, not necessary ones. If you find out that things change and you do something less/different, the committee may still sign off.\nSo, for example, a prelim is a great place to say something like:\nIn my dissertation I will demonstrate X by showing a simulation, not actually building the real thing.  Then, if the committee signs off on the prelim, then they can\u0026rsquo;t reject your dissertation if you only provide simulations. Of course, if you do built the real thing, then its probably OK.\nAn important aspect of the prelim is that it sets the expectation for what will be \u0026ldquo;enough\u0026rdquo; to be \u0026ldquo;done\u0026rdquo;. You might do this by explicitly listing the work - for example \u0026ldquo;my dissertation will have the following 4 experiments\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. I prefer to define \u0026ldquo;done\u0026rdquo; by the thesis.\nFor me, the main thing a prelim document does is shown that your thesis is a good thesis (or will be once you do it and write it up in a dissertation).\nSo your prelim document/presentation must show that you have the 5 things a good thesis must have:\n State the thesis that you will work on. I must be able to identify the sentence. Provide a thorough enough discussion of the related work to both show that your thesis is novel (i.e. not known to be true/false already). (see related work below). Provide enough motivation that the committee knows why the thesis is important. Show that the thesis is provable by explaining how you will prove/test your thesis to show that you are done. This is a big piece of expectation setting. Give a sense of why the thesis is significant by explaining why the problem (demonstrating the thesis) is hard, and what you intend to do about it. You may not know exactly what you are going to do, but you should give indication that you have a plausible plan, and that its feasible to succeed in a reasonable amount of time.  With the prelim #5 has an additional aspect: you need to show that your thesis isn\u0026rsquo;t too hard. You need to convince the committee that you have a high likelihood of being able to prove your thesis in a reasonable amount of time.\nIn my mind, everything else in a prelim is optional. Note: your other committee members might have other ideas of things that have to go into the prelim. For example:\n You need to demonstrate that you have fluency with the literature in the field (by providing a big enough survey of it). That you have a mastery of the required techniques (by writing a tutorial or survey) That you can write a big document (by having a length requirement)  I neither require, or even recommend these things unless some other committee member insists.\nIn your prelim document and talk, you should be explicit about what you expect your contributions to be. I recommend a slide in the talk, and a numbered list of expected contributions. They should be explained in the document, but its important to have a brief summary explicit and easy to find.\n6. The Related Work Section In my mind, there are two seperate issues in the thesis with regard to related work (in the prelim and the dissertation):\n You need to explain that your thesis is novel. You need to give enough background that your readers can understand your document. (by telling them where they can read more if they need to). Alternatively, you can view this as acknowledging the giants whose shoulders you stand on.  It is my preference that these two roles be distinct. And #1 is really whats essential.\nOther people might have other expectations. At least one person I know wants a big literature survey in the prelim so you can demonstrate that you really know the literature in your field.\nA dissertation can be a nice place for a good literature survey - when else do you get to take all the space you need to discuss the work done before. This is optional (in my mind). And should be done in a way that makes it clear what\u0026rsquo;s essential for the two things above.\n7. Some History Various forms of this document have been written by me over my career as a Professor. This version started around 2004. It got to its current form around 2008.\nWhile I believe what is written here, I am much less picky about it than I was when I wrote it. It quite simply isn\u0026rsquo;t worth the energy to write a \u0026ldquo;great\u0026rdquo; thesis - your goal should be good enough. No one really reads theses.\nMy opinions on this were shaped when I was a graduate student at CMU. Some of this by my committee (Brad Myers and Bob Sproull really forced me to think about what a thesis is, and Andy Witkin and Paul Heckbert helped me make sure I actually wrote one). A lot of it also came from other students. Olin Shivers, Todd Rockoff (who told me \u0026ldquo;a thesis is a statement to be defended\u0026rdquo;), Scott Nettles, Greg Morrissett, \u0026hellip;\n"},{"uri":"/pages/advice/talks/","title":"Advice on Talks","tags":[],"description":"","content":"I have written some advice on how to give a talk - that is the basis for a lecture in my grad classes.\nThese links are old - from a 2012 class pointing to a 2011 blog posting.

Medeley is in some ways a better alternative, but there are issues that the company that runs it treats your data in an unacceptable manner.\nThere are now a bunch of tools, online and desktop, for research reading management. I recommend you look at them and choose one that is appropriate for the way you work. I am using Mendeley (although, it was recently conquered by an evil publishing empire). It\u0026rsquo;s far from perfect, but I have made it work for me.\nI recommend that you keep this as a bibtex file - that way you don\u0026rsquo;t have to retype things when you need to put it into a paper.\nAt a bare minimum you should keep the full citation information (the more complete, the better - get page numbers, volume numbers, editor, and all those other BibTeX field that you probably don\u0026rsquo;t really care about). I also keep the following information along with each record:\n from - what pointed me at this reference? (example: \u0026ldquo;searched google for terms \u0026lsquo;psychophysics\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;referenced in paper X\u0026rdquo;) return - should I return to this paper? (example: \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; it deserves re-examination, \u0026ldquo;cite\u0026rdquo; it should be cited) read - did I actually read it? (example: \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;skim\u0026rdquo;) annote - some commentary on it. sometimes a short summary, but usually just enough to jog my memory as to what the paper was about, and any key bits I might need from it pdf - where to find it on the web? (this is a link - so maybe \u0026ldquo;html\u0026rdquo; would be a better field name) proj - which project does it pertain to? date - what date did I read it/enter it into the database?

It was the first time I taught the class.\nThe Course Web page is:\nhttp://www.cs.wisc.edu/graphics/Courses/Games10 \nCourse Announcement for Spring 2010: CS679: Computer Games Technology\nInstructor Mike Gleicher Time 2:30-3:45 MWF (note: there will not be 3 lectures per week. the extra class meeting time is scheduled so that students have a free time in their schedule for project group meetings) Prerequisites CS559 or consent of the instructor (see below) Intended Audience students who are interested in how computer games work, how the technologies behind computer games (like high performance graphics and rich internet applications) may be applied to other things, and/or want the experience of working on a non-trivial project as a group from design through testing.  The best place to get an idea of what this course will be like is to look at the web pages from previous years: 2008, 2007. Some things will change (I really do try to adapt the class to student interest).\nOverview In general, this is a class about the software that goes into making games. Its about how computer games work and how to build them. Its not about how to play them, or why people play them, or \u0026hellip;\nThis class is not focused on game design: we will spend some time discussing design (what makes a good game), since we need to understand games in order to really know how to make them (and to make good ones ourselves).\nThis class is an experiment. There are many things a class on \u0026ldquo;Game Technologies\u0026rdquo; could mean. There are many different \u0026ldquo;technologies\u0026rdquo; involved in interactive systems and games and many different ways to teach people about it. The idea here is to pick some of the software technologies that are used in interactive applications and games and some of the ways to learn about them, and see how they work out in a class setting.\nDuring this class, we\u0026rsquo;ll pick topics related to games that are some combination of:\n Things that people in the games industry have told me they think are valuable for students to learn in a class like this. CS topics that I think are important for computer games. Things that we are interested in learning more about (yes, I mean we as in you (the students in the class) and I). While this class is not \u0026ldquo;graphics 2\u0026rdquo;, there will be an emphasis on graphics and animation techniques that apply to interactive things like games. Projects that seem to be fun an interesting to do as part of a class like this.  If it sounds like I\u0026rsquo;m making this up as I go along, then you\u0026rsquo;ve read correctly.\nA big part of this class is its project orientation: you will work on a pretty significant project as part of a team. You\u0026rsquo;ll get to see a project go from the initial design stages all of the way through testing. Experience working as part of a team and following through on projects is something that is valuable (for example if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a job).\nAccording to the Course Catalog:\nSurvey of software technology important to computer games and other forms of interactive technology. Real-time image generation, managing complex geometric models, creating virtual characters, simulating physical phenomenon, networking technology for distributed virtual environments.\n Who can take it? The official prerequisite is CS559 (Computer Graphics) - but I am open to the idea that some people have learned equivalent material on their own, so if you\u0026rsquo;re \u0026ldquo;self-taught\u0026rdquo; you should contact me. Having taken a graphics class is useful because many of the \u0026ldquo;technologies\u0026rdquo; we discuss are graphics related (animation, shaders, \u0026hellip;).\nIf you really want to take this class, but have no graphics experience, please come talk to me. We might be able to work something out.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re an art/design/education/\u0026hellip; student who has a strong interest in game technology, we might be able to accomodate you. CS679 is targeted towards CS students who are experienced programmers - but if you have different (but relevant) skills, we might be able to adapt the class for you. You might need to sign up under a different number. Please contact Prof. Gleicher to discuss it.\n"},{"uri":"/video/","title":"Graphics Group Videos","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"/","title":"Mike Gleicher&#39;s Home Page","tags":[],"description":"","content":"   Michael Gleicher Professor Department of Computer Sciences University of Wisconsin, Madison 1210 West Dayton St. Madison, WI 53706 gleicher@cs.wisc.edu\nOffice Hour: (Fall 2021) Wednesdays 2-3pm or by appointment (in my office 6385CS).

If you aren\u0026rsquo;t a student at Wisconsin yet, please look at my grad school FAQ, particularly the last few questions.\nCurrent Research Themes    Communicating Physical Interactions:  We are working on ways for people and robots to communicate to each other about how objects should be manipulated in the world. Manipulations necessarily involve physical interactions (e.g., forces must be applied correctly). We are exploring ways for people to tell robots how to act with appropriate forces (e.g., to teach manipulation skills) as well as for robots to communicate back to people about the actions they are performing.         Communicative Robot Motions:  If robots are going to work around people, it will be important that people can interpret the robots movements correctly. We are developing ways to make robots move such that people will interpret them correctly. For example, we are considering how to design robot control algorithms such that the resulting movements are understandable, predictable, aesthetically pleasing, and convey a sense of appropriate affect (e.g. confidence).         Interacting with Machine Learning:  People interact with machine learning systems in many ways: they must build them, debug them, diagnose them, decide to trust them, gain insights on their data from them, etc. We are exploring this in both directions: How do we build machine learning tools into interactive data analysis in order to help people interpret large and complex data? How do we build interaction tools that can help people construct and diagnose machine learning models?         Visualizing Comparisons for Data Science:  Data interpretation tasks often involve making comparisons among the data, or can be thought of as comparisons. We are developing better visualization tools for performing comparisons for various data challenges, as well as to developing better methods for inventing new designs.      Selected Past (but recent) Themes    Communicative Characters:  We are working on better ways to synthesize human motions to make animated characters (both on screen and robots) that are better able to communicate. Generally, we focus on trying to make use of collections of examples (such as motion capture) to build models that allow us to generate novel movements, or to define models of communicative motions.         Perceptual Principles for Visualization:  Understanding how people see can inform how we should design visualizations. We have been exploring how recent results in perception (e.g., ensemble encoding) can be exploited to create novel visualization designs, and how principles of perception can inform visualization designs.         Visualizing English Print:  To drive our data science efforts, we took a specific application: working with English literature scholars to develop approaches to working with large collections of historical texts.         Video, Animation and Image Authoring:  Our goal is to make it easier for people to create useable images and video. For example, we have developed methods for improving pictures and video as a post-process (e.g. removing shadows and stabilizing video). We have also worked on adapting imagery for use in new settings (e.g. image and video retargeting or automatic video editing) and making use of large image collections (e.g. intestingness detection or panorama finding).     \nTeaching These are the main classes I teach. You can see more on the Graphics Group Courses Page.\n  CS765 Visualization: This class is taught regularly. I am teaching it Fall 2021. I taught it in Fall 2020 Fall 2019, Fall 2018, Fall 2017, and several times before that as \u0026ldquo;special topics\u0026rdquo; experiments.\n  CS559 Computer Graphics: I taught this most recently in Spring 2021. I taught the class using the current design in Spring 2020. and Spring 2019. Previous offerings include 2015, 2014, 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005, and others going back to 1999.\n  Older classes that might not get taught again for a while:\n CS777: Computer Animation is a graduate level CS class for people with some graphics background. This taught was taught regularly in the past (2013, 2011, 2006, 2004, 2003). It kindof died off from lack of interest (student interest and my interest) CS679 Computer Games Technologies: this class was popular, so I tried to teach it regularly for several years 2012, 2011, 2010). Advanced Graphics: In the Spring of 2009, I taught an Advanced Graphics class.

At the time, it was way better than anything else. It inspired later techniques, notably our 2009 3D Warping technique, and our 2010 Subspace Warping technique (which evolved into the Adobe Warp Stabilizer.).\nRe-Cinematography pushed the limits of what could be done with 2D global warps (using a single, 8 parameter projective warp over the entire image). The later techniques (e.g. SubSpace Video Stabilization (ToG 2011)) went beyond it by allowing for warping the image, not just global deformations.\nHowever, Re-Cinematography\u0026rsquo;s key insight was to try to make good camera movements. The ideas were really good: but the implementation is a bit of a hack (it works by piecing together spline segments with heuristics). Later work by Grundmann et. al gave a nice mathematical formulation to get the same dynamics. We used this L1 optimization approach in some of our later work (Zooming on All Actors and Multi-Clip Editing).\n Matthias Grundmann, Vivek Kwatra, and Irfan Essa. 2011. Auto-directed video stabilization with robust L1 optimal camera paths. In CVPR 2011, 225–232. DOI:10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995525.  Re-Cinematography is video stabilization taken to the next level: rather than just getting rid of some of the jitter, the methods try to figure out what camera movements might have been done by a professional with good equipment, and then alter the video to look like that.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t believe me, look at the video examples below! (or on the video page)\n1. Abstract This article presents an approach to postprocessing casually captured videos to improve apparent camera movement. Re-cinematography transforms each frame of a video such that the video better follows cinematic conventions. The approach breaks a video into shorter segments. Segments of the source video where there is no intentional camera movement are made to appear as if the camera is completely static. For segments with camera motions, camera paths are keyframed automatically and interpolated with matrix logarithms to give velocity-profiled movements that appear intentional and directed. Closeups are inserted to provide compositional variety in otherwise uniform segments. The approach automatically balances the tradeoff between motion smoothness and distortion to the original imagery. Results from our prototype show improvements to poor quality home videos.\n2. Papers The final journal paper:\n Michael Gleicher and Feng Liu. Re-Cinematography: Improving the Camerawork of Casual Video. ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing Communications and Applications (TOMCCAP), 5, 1, 2. October 2008. PDF EE/DOI  The original conference paper (that was best-in-track winner). Note: the journal paper (above) really is a big improvement. Some of the methods in the original paper are significantly improved, and there are new things added.\n Michael Gleicher and Feng Liu. Re-Cinematography: Improving the Camera Dynamics of Casual Video. ACM Multimedia 2007, best paper nominee. September 2007. PDF EE/DOI  3. Videos All source video was taken with a Sanyo Xacti C5 digicam (MPEG4, 640x480) with its default image stabilization on. So, all of these examples can be considered a comparison with the state of the art. Most videos include a side-by-side comparison with the source, as well as a 2X comparison.\nNote that the examples are all full frame: we don\u0026rsquo;t crop artifacts at the edges (like we did in some later work). The problem is that the method often has to guess what is off the frame, and these artifacts come from guessing badly.\nThere is a \u0026ldquo;video paper\u0026rdquo; that is almost 9 minutes long that was used to explain what was in the paper (it was targeted towards reviewers). It includes the examples below (but not in the order on the web page).\nUnfortunately, the short clips only exist in an old video format. Please see the the video page\n3.1 Examples see the video\n3.2 Illustrative Examples (animated diagrams from paper) see the video\n3.3 Extra Examples (lost to history \u0026hellip;)\n3.4 Artifacts If you look at the video, you will undoubtedly notice artifacts. The biggest ones come from the fact that when we move the camera viewpoint, a portion of the frame becomes uncovered. In re-cinematography, we choose to \u0026ldquo;fill in\u0026rdquo; these portions of the frame from previous frames - in the future or the past. Here\u0026rsquo;s a dramatic example from the \u0026ldquo;swing\u0026rdquo; video above:\n source frame   result frame    Notice that the woman in the red hat doesn\u0026rsquo;t appear in the source image - we had to pull here from another part of the video!\nOur system uses a simple method for fill in, however, the system will look up to 3 seconds in the past or future to find things to use for fill in. The alternative would be to crop the frame - and make the resulting video tiny. This is what we did in the later 3D stabilization work. Its a tradeoff.\n4. Follow on work In follow on work, we are developing better methods to fix camera motions. Our first is a \u0026ldquo;3D Warping\u0026rdquo; method (Siggraph 2009 paper). It provides better results, when it works. Re-Cinematography gets decent/good results on hard examples, while 3D warping gets great results on not-so-hard examples. For some technical (and some pragmatic) reasons, we really haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to run both methods on the same examples.\n"},{"uri":"/researchtheme/","title":"Research Themes","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"/pages/advice/statusreports/","title":"Status Reports","tags":[],"description":"","content":"If you work for me (for example, as an RA or an undergrad directed study) you must send me a status report every week.\nI have found this to be a useful tool not just for the \u0026ldquo;reviewer\u0026rdquo;(e.g. me reading this), but also for the person writing it. I really believe if you spend 15 minutes doing this every week, you will be more productive in the long run.\nOne of the things that I have found over the years is that its quite easy to forget what you\u0026rsquo;ve accomplished, forget what you were trying to do, forget to think about what you should be doing, \u0026hellip; I, therefore, have found it really useful to write periodic reports that force me to think about these things, and leave a record so I can remember what I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing. The form of this report is designed to foster that kind of thought, and to help identify problems that may crop up.\nYour report should be sent to me by email on Friday of each week (if you choose to do it over the weekend, or on Monday morning, that\u0026rsquo;s OK - but be consistent). Please send it with the title \u0026ldquo;NAME\u0026rsquo;s status report for 9/1/2005\u0026rdquo; (important: make sure you have your name and the date in the report since I get a bunch of these). Be sure to save a copy for yourself (so at the end of a semester we can look back at them). Please send me the status report in the text of an email - not as an attachment.\nYour report should have the following following 6 sections:\n What were my goals for this week? What did I accomplish this week? Why are numbers 1 and 2 different? What are my goals for next week? How does this fit in to my bigger picture? How does #4 fit into my longer term goals? (What are the longer term goals?) What deadlines are looming beyond the week horizon? What did I read this week?  Additionally: If you are an hourly employee, please list the hours you worked. I\u0026rsquo;m curious when you worked and what you did (at least roughly). If you are also doing directed study work, I am curious what you consider \u0026ldquo;paid time\u0026rdquo; versus what you consider part of directed study? I trust that people work when they say they worked, but it\u0026rsquo;s useful for me to make sure people are working on the right things, and to understand how long various things take.\nImportant: Status reports are to help understand how things are progressing. It is much better to file a status report saying that little got done than it is to wait until you have something you are proud of. File one every week - whether you accomplished anything or not.\nSome comments on these questions:  The time management literature (especially the books by Covey and Allen) say that a week is the right size time chunk to do planning at: days are too \u0026ldquo;micro\u0026rdquo;, months are too long. However, working along week by week, its way too easy to lose track of the big picture. The \u0026ldquo;macro\u0026rdquo; planning process is seperate from the weekly report. We should do semester scale planning as well, but that is independent of the weekly report. Number 1 is not necessarily the previous weeks #4 - in practice, goals change over time. It\u0026rsquo;s best to be honest about number 3 - it\u0026rsquo;s a great place to identify roadblocks that come up. Question #5 is designed to help reconnect to the big picture. I left it out initially from my suggested format. It\u0026rsquo;s not meant to take the place of periodic long-term planning. Question #6 is a new addition. It is added for a number of reasons. First, I had been concerned that many people get so caught up in hacking or the specific thing they are doing that they aren\u0026rsquo;t reading - which is an important part of research. Second, I am not getting to read as much as I would like, so this is a way for me to hear about more stuff vicariously. For the purposes of the status report DON\u0026rsquo;T PUT THE WHOLE CITATION. Just give me enough information so I have an idea of what it is. For example:   Interactive Video Cutout, SIGGRAPH 2005  Is totally sufficient.   Putting non-research stuff in 1-5 is a good idea. For exmaple, its good to know that you have an exam during the week so you might not get as much research work done, or that you didn\u0026rsquo;t get enough work done on your class project because you\u0026rsquo;re busy doing research. I\u0026rsquo;m less interested in non-research related readings (#6) unless you feel that it is relevant.

There is specific advice for students who are applying to Wisconsin, and even more specifically, might like to work with me.\nMike Gleicher\u0026rsquo;s Graduate School FAQ (added summer, 2020) This document is almost comically out of date. The old version was copied to the new web page.\n2003 (when a lot of this was written) seems like a different universe. But a lot of the things are timeless: the value of graduate school, how to pick a place, the fact the I play no role in admissions, \u0026hellip;\nAlso, why the document refers to the area of \u0026ldquo;graphics,\u0026rdquo; that\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a misnomer. We call ourselves the \u0026ldquo;graphics group\u0026rdquo; but the research is robotics, vis, \u0026hellip;\nSomeday, I will re-write this from scratch\u0026hellip;\n(added summer, 2016):\nThis document is getting really out of date, and deserves an overhaul. A lot of the main messages hold. However, as of right now (August 2016) I am actively seeking new students to work with - especially in areas where we have ongoing projects (Robotics and Data Visualization). If you\u0026rsquo;re a student here at Wisconsin, come talk to me. If you\u0026rsquo;re not a student here, try to become one.\n(added June, 2013):\nThe most recent update to this document was in 2010! Some of it was out of date in 2003. It\u0026rsquo;s really interesting to see what is a timeless truth (and still true from when I wrote it in 2001), and what is out of date. The parts about how our admissions process works, and how I find students seem to change more slowly.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re a student who is considering applying for grad school at Wisconsin and want to work with me, you are probably most interested in the last few questions below. But the summary:\n I am not on the admissions committee, so I have little control over whether you will be admitted to Wisconsin. If you are accepted by the committee and are interested in the kinds of things I work on, we should talk (after you are accepted). I am eager to find students that are a good fit for my group. There is a growing amount of opportunity to work in graphics and visualization and related fields (HCI, VR, \u0026hellip;).  I tend to get a lot of people asking me questions about grad school. It ended to get the same questions over and over, so rather than write short answers each time, I decided to compile my answers so I could say more about each request.\nHere is that email, tossed into an HTML page. Its evolved a little bit since its humble beginnings - I have not being trying to keep this that up to date, but a lot of the things are timeless.\nNote: Some of this is quite old (circa 2001), but still relevant. While not a lot has been added since, out of date things have been removed.\nEnough people ask me about this that I figure I should write it down\u0026hellip; So began this FAQ.\nFirst: All of this is my opinion. The grad school admissions game has no set rules (at least no place I know). My experience includes being on the admissions committee a few times, and doing undergrad advising for a few years.\nI used to start at zero, not because it was a CS joke, but because the first question really is more fundamental than all of the later ones\nAlso, now that I\u0026rsquo;m using automatic numbering, it\u0026rsquo;s harder to control.\n1. Should I go to graduate school? Short version: (pick one of these)\n maybe, if it is right for you yes! grad school is great!  This is a tough personal question. My feeling is: you should go to graduate school if, and only if, it is the right thing for you todo. But its such a great thing, that erring on the side of going is probably wise.\nThis defies the conventional wisdom that says that all smart people should go to graduate school. Many of my colleagues feel this way. Partially from the economic argument (it will pay off), partially from the \u0026ldquo;what\u0026rsquo;s good for me is good for you\u0026rdquo; angle.\nNick Feamster has a well-written article that has a very parallel viewpoint, focused on a Ph. D. (the reasons for a masters degree are quite different).\n2001 version: In practice, I don\u0026rsquo;t think grad school is for every one. Over the past few years, the economic argument hasn\u0026rsquo;t beena s strong (although, as the economy slows, \u0026hellip;).\n2005 version: The job market today (2005) is quite different, and there are major shifts (such as outsourcing, and the maturing of the field) that make the future hard to predict.\n2009 version: The job market is totally weird nowadays. However,things seem much better for people with CS degrees.\n2013 version: The \u0026lsquo;CS job market is incredibly hot (note that this is not necessarily true for other fields). If you\u0026rsquo;re good, you can get a good job. Grad school can help make you even more attractive to (some) employers, and there are some kinds of jobs that it\u0026rsquo;s easier to get with a graduate degree.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen lots of smart people for whom grad school was exactly the wrong thing. One in particular was pushed into going to grad school by an advisor (partially for selfish reasons - he wanted the student to work on a project). It was the worst thing that happened to each of them. Fortunately, this particular student dropped out of grad school before they lost their enthusiasm for the field, and has had a successful career in the animation industry.\nHowever: I think grad school is a great thing. It\u0026rsquo;s really the only time where you get to focus your energies on learning about the things that you care about the most, and to be given the time and opportunity to explore things that you might find interesting. It\u0026rsquo;s better than being an undergrad because you can be more focused, it\u0026rsquo;s better than being a professor because you can devote all of your time to learning and your projects. Maybe being a post-doc is better, but I have no first hand experience.\nIn fact, the worst thing (IMHO) about grad school is that you don\u0026rsquo;t realize how amazing it is, and you rush through it.\nHowever, if you think you might want to go to grad school\u0026hellip;\n1.1 When should I go? Immediately after finishing your undergrad degree, unless you have exceptional circumstances.\nBasically, \u0026ldquo;real life\u0026rdquo; is addictive. You graduate, get a real job, get used to having a real salary, forget how to stay focused and study, \u0026hellip; David DeWitt (who feels much more strongly about this one than I do) told my student some sobering statistics about how students who say they will come back never do.\n2013 Update: I keep meeting more people who work for a year or two, realize that the kinds of things you can do with a graduate degree are different from the kinds of things you can do without it, and then come back to grad school.\n2. I have an X GPA, and Y. Where can I realistically think to get into? First, there are no set rules.\nSecond, things change. For example, when the economy is good, many smart students want to take jobs, so the applicant pool (especially of domestic students) becomes a little weaker. While I think there are hard thresholds (we won\u0026rsquo;t accept someone we don\u0026rsquo;t think can succeed),I think the total pool quality has an effect: especially at a place like UW where we need to admit enough students to have TAs\nThird, there are many factors. Grades, recommendations, experience,research background, \u0026hellip; GRE scores are usually reserved as a \u0026ldquo;sanity check\u0026rdquo; (e.g. if they are really bad, we might wonder). I have mixed feelings about the importance of an essay. I think it has a lot more importance at smaller places, or places that admit you because you want to work on something specific. (at Wisconsin, we don\u0026rsquo;t do that \u0026mdash; we admit you, and let you decide what you want to work on).\n2001 version: As a rough rule of thumb, a 3.5 GPA (from a good place) and a\u0026quot;generally good\u0026quot; package (letters, \u0026hellip;) should get you into most of the second tier places (bottom half of the top ten, like UW). Students with a 3.0 GPA and some amazing experience (research publications,\u0026hellip;) might get in. Doing well in hard CS courses counts more than overall GPA, and positive trends always look good (we all screw up our freshman years, if you screw up your upper level courses, that can be a bad sign).\n2003 version: After 2-3 years of a bad CS job market, grad school admissions has gotten crazy. All good grad schools are getting hundreds (if not thousands) of applicants. The number of spaces in the programs is not going up (if anything, its going down, since a tightened economy means less funding). Over the past 2 years, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen good students with good grades who have trouble getting in anywhere in the top 20. These are people who 3-4 years ago would have no problem getting in here.\nIn this kind of admissions market, the problem changes. You need to stand out from the crowd, and you need to make it through mechanical cutting processes.\n2013 version: The good CS job market (over the long term) has changed the admissions game, again. We get huge numbers of applications from Asia - so getting in if you\u0026rsquo;re from China, India, or really any Asian country is really really hard. However, if you\u0026rsquo;re from the US, the story is quite different. The admissions committee seems to be much more willing to take chances on people.\n3. I am considering working for a year or two after my BS. Is this a good idea? From an admissions point of view, I don\u0026rsquo;t think it matters much. The biggest issues will be you references: your professors will forget you, but the people you work with might be able to write letters.\nFrom a personal standpoint, this can either be a great thing, or a bad thing. Depending on your personal situation, you might need some time to experience the real world, and figure out \u0026ldquo;what you want to do with your life.\u0026rdquo; Students who come back from the real world are always there for a reason: they didn\u0026rsquo;t just come to grad school \u0026ldquo;because they couldn\u0026rsquo;t think of what else to do.\u0026rdquo;\nThe downside is that you might get used to the real world - the real salary, the \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; hours, the paid vacations, \u0026hellip;\n4. What can I do to improve my chances? Well, I am assuming raising your GPA is out of the question, so\u0026hellip;\n(revised for 2013)\nThe biggest thing is to show some initiative. Do something out of the ordinary. A student who takes normal classes and gets good grades is common - a student who has an interesting internship, or has done a research project, or even did an interesting project just for fun, is more likely to stand out.\nMake sure that some people know you. If you just \u0026ldquo;do well in your classes\u0026rdquo; you\u0026rsquo;ll get things that we call \u0026ldquo;DWIC\u0026rdquo; letters (did well in class). Having a professor say \u0026ldquo;Student was in my class and got an A\u0026rdquo; tells us little, having a professor or supervisor who worked directly with you and can give specific examples of your abilities is much more compelling. (the reference letters are important!)\nFor example: get some research experience. Show that you can do the stuff, and build a relationship with a potential letter writer. A research supervisor gets to know you a lot better than someone who teaches a class.\n5. Where should I go? Some thoughts:\n I think that its a good idea to go someplace different for grad school than where you were an undergrad. Get to experience something new, try out a new place, \u0026hellip; You can always move back. How well do you know what you want to do? Some places are good if you want to check stuff out for a while and then decide. Others places make you decide when you apply, and basically commit to a life in that group. Personally, I believe that its good to go somewhere that is accepting of people that don\u0026rsquo;t know what they want to do. Even if you know what you want to do, you might change your mind for some reason. Geography. It matters. Go someplace you\u0026rsquo;d want to live. Having a life outside the lab is actually good for you. Consider if you want to be in a big or a small place. At any quality level, there is a whole range.  6. Where is good for graphics? First, read the last thing. When I went to grad school I had no idea I wanted to do graphics, and kind of stumbled into it. I know plenty of people who change their mind.\nAlso, the places that are \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; for graphics, aren\u0026rsquo;t necessarily good places to be a graphics grad student. Sometimes these places attract lots of students, and its easy to get lost in the shuffle.\nOn the other hand, there is something to be said for being from a place with a strong group. You will learn at least as much from your peers as from anything else.\n(2005 Update: I used to have a list of places with graphics groups,but it had gotten woefully out of date.)\n7. Will they pay me? If you are in a professional masters program, probably not.\nYour best bet is to not have them pay you. If you go to grad school apply for all of the \u0026ldquo;prestige\u0026rdquo; fellowships (like NSF). These are given to new grad students, are very selective, but are nice since they pay well and are very prestigious.\nAt most good places, most/all students are supported. Here areWisconsin, we used to have enough TA jobs that we could pay all students (that\u0026rsquo;s changed recently). Generally, if you are working on aPhD, you will be funded as an RA (Research Assistant) which means that your advisor will be paying you to do research. Generally, most masters students are supported someway.\n8. Should I get a Masters degree or a PhD. This is a tough personal question. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know the answer already, you should assume that you just want a masters degree but be open minded to the fact that you will change your mind.\nIn fact, if you think you know the answer, you should be open minded that something will change your mind.\nGenerally, this means you should consider whether a program will allow you to do one or the other.\nSome thoughts:\n It is difficult to justify a PhD in terms of career opportunities(unless you want to work in a government lab or be a professor). The real justification for a PhD is the personal growth experience. If you poo-poo this, then its probably not for you. While the time commitment for a PhD seems huge (and it is!), it really is an investment in yourself. Besides, you will probably find grad school to be a lot of fun. In hindsight, most people look back on it as one of the best times in their lives. (while you\u0026rsquo;re going through it it might seem hellish, but in hindsight)  9. What area of CS should I work in? Graphics, of course :-)\nSeriously, you should work in an area that you enjoy working in. Especially if you are getting a PhD.\nPush comes to shove, your thesis topic may not have a huge impact on your life. (there are plenty of people who change areas post-PhD, and some who continue to work on the topic for the rest of their careers).\nOften, other factors will influence you. For example, the personalities of the faculty and research groups. For example, if you come to Wisconsin and don\u0026rsquo;t want to work in a lab environment, the graphics group might seem less attractive. Or if you come here and find that you don\u0026rsquo;t get along with Eftychios and I.\nFinally, it is not a crime to not know what you are interested in. When I applied to grad school I did know: I was definitely going to have a career in VLSI CAD tools. By the time I showed up to grad school 8 months later, all I was sure of was that I did not want to work on this stuff. I ended up starting out in graphics/physical simulation - fields I pretty much didn\u0026rsquo;t know existed before I got to grad school.\n10. I want to work with you. Can I? Let me break that into two parts: (1) if you need to be admitted here,and (2) you\u0026rsquo;re already a Wisconsin student.\nAug 2009: I am actively seeking to grow my group, so I am eager to find students that are a good fit.\n2013: I still am looking to grow the group\n10.1 I want to come to Wisconsin and work with you. Can I? If you are not a student at Wisconsin, you first need to become one.\nThe admissions committee is pretty much area blind: a departmental committee evaluates your application. Just because I think you\u0026rsquo;d be a good graphics student has almost no effect. Even those times that I am on the admissions committee, I am generally given responsibility for only a portion of the applicant pool, and have little influence over most graphics applicants.\nGetting admitted to our department is difficult. We only take people with really good records, and we don\u0026rsquo;t even take all of the people who are \u0026ldquo;good enough\u0026rdquo;. So, if you think you might be good enough,apply. If you\u0026rsquo;re good enough, you might get in. But there are so many applications, many good people get rejected.\nAnd if you\u0026rsquo;re good enough (and lucky enough) to get in, and serious enough about graphics, that will lead to the next answer\u0026hellip;\n10.2 I\u0026rsquo;m already a Wisconsin grad student. Can I work with you? If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in what I do, and fit in well with the culture of our group, I will probably want to work with you. But there\u0026rsquo;s a question below on how I pick students to work with.\nBack in the old days, I used to say \u0026ldquo;I have a hard time saying no to good students who fit in with our group.\u0026rdquo; Things have changed a bit. Taking on too many students isn\u0026rsquo;t good for anyone (me, my existing students, or the new student).\nIf you are already a grad student here in our department (CS) and are interested in the kinds of things I do, please come talk to me. I am still on the lookout for people who are good matches for our group. Even if I am unable to take on another student, I may have some other ideas for you. Its important to me that good graphics students in the CS department get to work on the things that they want to -even if we need to find non-traditional ways to do it. (see the last question below)\nUpdate 2010: We have hired another faculty member, Eftychios Sifakis, with interests in graphics. He\u0026rsquo;ll be starting in January 2011.\nUpdate 2013: if you\u0026rsquo;re a really good fit, and/or have background in a domain area we\u0026rsquo;re working in, anything is possible.\nIf you are already a grad student here in another department (like ECE or ME), we should probably talk. Be warned that it is difficult for me to support a non-CS student, and unlikely that I would support a non-CS student that I haven\u0026rsquo;t already had a working relationship with. You should probably start by taking CS559 as a way to demonstrate your abilities. Also, be warned that switching to CS from some other department is very hard.\n10.3 How do you pick students to support as an RA? (added 2013) Note: the question of how I choose RAs is not exactly the same as choosing who I work with.\nGenerally, I prefer to work (on research) with students that I have already gotten to know well enough that I am fairly confident that we are a good fit. This is as much for them (the students) as for me: as an advisor, I have many students; as a student you have one advisor (so you better have the right one).\nMost students I work with take a class with me first. Also, I like to do small projects with students (usually as a directed study).\n11. Can I do Graphics at Wisconsin? This is a slightly complex question.\nFirst, there is the issue of being accepted in our CS program. At present, admission is \u0026ldquo;area blind\u0026rdquo; - that is, we don\u0026rsquo;t care what you say you\u0026rsquo;re interested in, just that you\u0026rsquo;re good. When you get here,you can figure out what you want to work on.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;re here, there\u0026rsquo;s the issue that the graphics group is presently  very  small - but growing. And given the limits of my time, energy and funding, the number of students I can supervise is limited. (see the previous question)\n2013: I am often looking for new students to work with.\nHowever, the situation is not totally bleak:\n I will always take on people that seem to be a particularly good fit, although sometimes that\u0026rsquo;s hard to identify. There are people around in related areas! There are many faculty around campus who do graphics-related things. I am happy to help make connections and to try and start collaborative efforts.  So, if you\u0026rsquo;re a Wisconsin CS student and interested in graphics, talk to me. Visit the lab and get to know the graphics students. Take the classes.\n12. I am applying, is there anything I can do to help my chances? By the time you apply, there is little you can do to change your record, and that\u0026rsquo;s what really matters.\nMentioning specifics about your research interests (in your statement) is good. It is good to show that you\u0026rsquo;ve done your homework and identified people (like me) and projects in the department that you find interesting. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in graphics, definitely express that as one of your area choices.\nMake sure that you choose good letter writers, people who simply write \u0026ldquo;this student did well in my class\u0026rdquo; (we call it a DWIC letter) aren\u0026rsquo;t as useful as people who have really worked with you.\nThese next two questions were added in 2010, since they are literally what people are asking. You should have figured out the answers already, but just to make it totally clear.\n13. Do you have openings on your research team / in your research group? In case you haven\u0026rsquo;t figured it out: I don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;have openings.\u0026rdquo; When I find someone I want to work with (and they want to work with me), we find a way to do it - after they have been admitted by the admissions committee.\n13.1 Are you recruiting students for your group for next year? Usually, students are asking the same as the \u0026ldquo;openings\u0026rdquo; question. But I am always encouraging good students to apply (and to come, if the admissions committee accepts them).\n13.2 Will you accept Ph. D. students for next year? No. I do not accept students. The admissions committee does that.\n"},{"uri":"/pages/graveyard/vis10announce/","title":"Visualization 2010 Course Announcement","tags":[],"description":"","content":"This is the historic announcement for the first time I offered a visualization class in 2010. It was an experiment that keeps going to this day (2020 as I write this). It\u0026rsquo;s pretty interesting that even at the beginning, I had the same ideas as to the goals of the class.\nThe course web page is at\nhttp://www.cs.wisc.edu/graphics/Courses/Visualization10 \nThis is a course announcement for the first (2010) time I tried to teach a visualization course.\n Course Announcement for Spring 2010: CS838: Visualization: getting from data to understanding\nSpring Course Announcement: CS838: Visualization: getting from data to understanding\nInstructor Mike Gleicher TimeTuesday/Thursday 11-12:15 Prerequisites none Intended Audience students who work with data and need to use visualizations effectively and students who are interested in creating tools to help people work with data Creditsnominally 3, but variable credit possible (especially for dissertators)  Please contact the instructor if you are interested.\nThis course will explore the foundations of visualization: how we turn data into pictures to help in understanding or communicating it. We\u0026rsquo;ll cover visualization in the broad sense: including scientific visualization, information visualization (the presentation of abstract data), and visual analytics (the use of interactive tools for exploring large and/or complex data sets).\nThe content (the topics, not the teaching style) of this course is modeled after the visualization courses at Harvard (cs171) and Berkeley (cs294). Here, we will teach the class in a bit more of a \u0026ldquo;seminar\u0026rdquo; style - using class time more for discussion and student presentations than lectures.\nOverview Visualizations range from crayon sketches on the back of a napkin to immersive virtual reality display of the fluid dynamics around an airplane; from a bar chart in excel to a fancy, realistic 3D model.\nOur goals are to understand the principles that lead to effective visualizations across this range (design, the use of color and motion, basic design patterns, dealing with high-dimensional data, \u0026hellip;),specific visualization designs and problems (treemaps, scatterplot matrices, focus+context, volume visualization, \u0026hellip;),as well as looking at the kinds of systems and tools that support the creation of good visualizations.\nBy the end of the course, we will learn how to design effective visualizations for the kinds of data we want to interpret and understand the kinds of tools that support the creation of such visualizations.\nFor a more complete description, I steal this from the course at Berkeley (with 2 sentences removed):\nIn this course we will study techniques and algorithms for creating effective visualizations based on principles and techniques from graphic design, visual art, perceptual psychology and cognitive science. The course is targeted both towards students interested in using visualization in their own work, as well as students interested in building better visualization tools and systems. In addition to participating in class discussions, students will have to complete several short programming and data analysis assignments as well as a final project.\n"},{"uri":"/pages/advice/writeups/","title":"Write-Ups for Directed Study Projects (699s)","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Making a final writeup for your directed study project (or summer intern project, or honors thesis project, or \u0026hellip;) is important. Reflecting on what you\u0026rsquo;ve done is an important part of the learning process.\nYour write-up is important for a number of reasons:\n It helps you learn from the experience by reflecting on it. It documents what you\u0026rsquo;ve done so others can gain from it. It makes it possible for others to pick up where you left off. Even if the next person is \u0026ldquo;your future self.\u0026rdquo; It helps in evaluating the project (which is particularly important if you need to be graded).  Note: even if you are continuing the project, writing it up at the end of the semester/summer is a good idea: thing of it as a way to reflect and learn from what has happened, and to pass along the knowledge to the person who is going to continue. That person may be your future self, so be nice.\nWrite up contents I ask that everyone follows a similar format. The exact form is less important than having all of the parts.\nThings to include:\n your original project proposal (if you had one) the source code for your project (for example in a zip file). make sure there is enough info so someone else might be able to build/use it. (note: a preferred thing for source code is that it is in a GitHub repository that is part of uwgraphics) some example results (this might include a running demo, videos, images, use case descriptions, etc.) a bibliography - list the things you\u0026rsquo;ve read for this project. Besure to give a complete enough reference (a real citation, author,title, etc). I\u0026rsquo;d prefer an annotated bibliography (that is one where you give a brief description of each reference, maybe including what you\u0026rsquo;ve gotten out of it.). the final project document  I recommend creating a web page with links to all these things (and a brief description).\nYour final document should include these 4 sections:\n  Describe your results\nA description of what your final result is. Describe what you\u0026rsquo;ve achieved. Explain the methods it uses, what the software does, how it might be used, what its limitations are, \u0026hellip; Describe how you\u0026rsquo;ve evaluated the results.\nYou should give some documentation for what you\u0026rsquo;re handing in.\nYou should think of this not just in terms of evaluation, but also in terms of project continuity: what does someone need to know so they can pick up the project where you left off. Even if the person continuing the project is your future self, try to be nice to them.\nYou may want to describe what you tried that didn\u0026rsquo;t work - sometimes the \u0026ldquo;research\u0026rdquo; is a negative results (knowing what not to do in the future).\n  Describe the work that you did\nDescribe how you got to your result. Where did your time actually go? What did you try that didn\u0026rsquo;t make it into the final result? What was hard/easy?\nThis should be relatively easy to do because you can look back at your Status Reports.\n  Describe what you **learned** from this project\nThe primary goal is for you to learn something (this is a class). Describe what you\u0026rsquo;ve gotten out of doing this project. There will probably be a list of technical and non-technical things that you\u0026rsquo;ve learned.\n  A self-evaluation\nHow happy with you with how the project turned out (remember, the goal isn\u0026rsquo;t just the result - its also what you\u0026rsquo;ve gotten out of doing it). What would you do differently next time? What would you tell someone else who is about to start a similar project?\n  Code, Documentation, Resources Make sure that as much of what you\u0026rsquo;ve created is available for others and archived.\nThis means more than just providing a ZIP or repository of the code - be sure to have enough documentation that someone can figure out what there is, how to use it, and where to start if they want to try to extend it.\nPlease check that all files are present.\nIf you have a GitHub repository, please have a copy as part of uwgraphics. This might either be by transfering ownership, or allowing us to fork/clone your personal repo.\nIt is probably good for every directory to have a readme file.\nFor large data objects (e.g. videos), we probably need a storage mechanism other than GitHub.\n"},{"uri":"/pages/advice/paperrecipe/","title":"Writing Advice: The Paper &#34;Recipe&#34;","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Let me tell you a little trick that I tell all the students:\n sentence, paragraph, page\n Mike\u0026rsquo;s paper recipe:\n  come up with 1 sentence that tells the \u0026ldquo;story\u0026rdquo; of the paper - the main message. you need to make this into one sentence. if the sentence is a long, run-on sentence (or is a paragraph, not a sentence), you don\u0026rsquo;t have a focused enough message. Keep the sentence in view at all times (print it out in big letters and put it next to your computer as you work!   write the 1st paragraph of the paper - how you will hook the reader in, introduce the problem, \u0026hellip; This is not the abstract.  Starting with the beginning of the paper is important since it focuses on \u0026ldquo;what the paper is\u0026rdquo;. It also exposes challenges in wording: how are you going to explain it to a reviewer who doesn\u0026rsquo;t know the terminology you want to us?   write a 1 page outline of the paper in each part, keep in mind that your goal is to tell the \u0026ldquo;story\u0026rdquo; of the paper - which is why the sentence is so important.\n  Note: I do not recommend starting with the outline (#3), or the abstract (#2 is not the abstract).\nThe additional advice below is how to think about doing these things, and some details about how to write the introduction after you have the sentence/paragraph/page.\nThe new recipe below can help you think about \u0026ldquo;the sentence\u0026rdquo; - you might include writing them as part of step 1, or mixed in with step 2, or as part of writing the introduction after completing step 3.\nUpdate (3/6/2015)\u0026hellip; Here are a few other questions you should try to answer while developing those three things:\n Our key idea is\u0026hellip; Our primary contribution is \u0026hellip; The contributions of this paper are: (list)  The first two of those should be sentences. Not run-ons. Not lists. Your \u0026ldquo;primary\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;key\u0026rdquo; thing must be a thing, not 3.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a nice article on Tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s Professor about writing. They echo my feelings about the importance of the \u0026ldquo;sentence.\u0026rdquo; Some of their other advice, I don\u0026rsquo;t implement myself - but wish I did! They have a lot of good articles (I stopped reading it about 10 years ago).\nAddition (9/25/2018) - sent from Mike to Manfred, Sept 2018 \u0026hellip; Here\u0026rsquo;s another set of questions that is often useful to think about: The 5 questions:\n What is the PROBLEM Why is it interesting Why is it hard Why do other approaches fail How is our approach different  The new paper recipe - New thing, March 2019 This is based on how the intro needs to \u0026ldquo;work\u0026rdquo;.\nThe intro has to do 4 things. I think there should be a single sentence that answers each, which makes it easy for a reader to identify/get a summary of these things. Some intros are less explicit, but I think all good intros address these points.\n What is the problem? What is the solution? (what is this paper) What is the key idea? (why is this a paper) So What?  1. What is the problem? This usually gets set up by saying what happens now, and then gets to the \u0026ldquo;However\u0026rdquo;. The first part is something the reader can connect to (the world they know). Then you connect it to the new stuff by defining the problem. This common pattern is discussed in the Williams and Bissup Style book.\nKey sentence 1: However, \u0026hellip; (we have a problem)\n2. What is the solution? What does this paper give the reader? Hopefully its an answer to the question/problem set up in 1:\nKey sentence 2: In this paper we \u0026hellip; (give a solution)\n3. What is the key idea / takeaway? At some point, you need to say why it was worth writing a paper about this. An explicit contribution statement can do this. But I think its even better if you can identify an intellectual core from which the paper will build. What made it possible for you to solve this problem (where no one else has before).\nKey sentence 3: Our key idea is \u0026hellip; (give an intellectual core)\n4. So What? Why should the reader care? What actual progress have you made at addressing the solution? Why is the world a better place with the ideas in your paper in it?\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have a formulaic sentence for this. It can take many forms. One common pattern is: Our results/system/method/technique/ideas enables/provide/allows \u0026hellip;\nWriting I don\u0026rsquo;t think that every paper has to have the formulaic sentences as explicit sentences in simple form. But I do think that writing these 4 sentences early in the writing process is valuable. If you can\u0026rsquo;t express these 4 functions concisely, you will have problems building a coherent paper.\nOther Resources Best Book on Writing - Ever The absolute best book on writing I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen is Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace by Williams and Bizup. Note that the 12th edition is different than early editions, and is formatted in a way that is much easier. This book was recommended to me by some of my English Professor colleagues. It is truly amazing because it makes good writing into a procedural process. It gives specific advice on how to think about writing.\nGet this book and look at it. It will change the way you think about writing. It will give you specific things you can do to make your writing better. It will not only tell you what to do, it will tell you why, and how to learn to do it. I wish I practiced all of its lessons.\nYes, there are plenty of other good books and writing. But no other book I\u0026rsquo;ve seen is as actionable. It explains what to do, why to do it, and how to learn to do it. It is a great mix of \u0026ldquo;levels\u0026rdquo;: it considers everything from how to write good sentences to how to organize papers.\nOther choices: not an exhaustive list, but other books that I have looked at over the years:\n Strunk and White\u0026rsquo;s Elements of Style is a timeless classic. I like the illustrated edition. Zinsser\u0026rsquo;s On Writing Well is another classic. I found Pinker\u0026rsquo;s The Sense of Style to be interesting because it related cognitive science to writing. It explains why good writing is more effective with real scientific depth. It is great at the \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; of good writing, but less helpful at the how. This article on a key point will give you the main idea in 2 seconds.  Quick Article with Easy Points I like this article 3 Ways to Make Your Writing Clearer. In particular, the \u0026ldquo;since the dawn of time\u0026rdquo; comment really resonated with me. All of these echo what is in Williams and Bizzup - but these are 3 little quick tricks. The three points, which state rich advice in a wonderfully concise manner:\n Cut the “since the dawn of time” opening and get right to the point Turn those descriptive topic sentences into topic sentences that make claims Make sure people are doing things in your sentences, unless you don’t want them to be doing things  I love these - since they get 3 key points from Williams fast.\nSome other references Seth Hutchinson, IEEE Trans Robotics, on how to think about revising papers in response to reviews: Surviving the Review Process. This echoes what I tell people, but it comes from a more authoritative source. A favorite quote:\n If a Reviewer Does Not Understand Your Paper, Take Responsibility\n "}]
