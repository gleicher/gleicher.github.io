I get many requests from students from my classes to provide reference letters for graduate school applications. I will not provide these letters.
I will provide letters for students that I get to know outside of regular classes. For example, if you are involved in a directed study project or work with me as a peer mentor for a class (that&amp;rsquo;s why it says &amp;ldquo;as a student&amp;rdquo;).</description></item></channel></rss>
