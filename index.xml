I ask that everyone do these things, even if at first they may not be required.
Before you can start officially, you must complete &amp;ldquo;Responsible Conduct of Research&amp;rdquo; Training. https://research.wisc.edu/integrity-and-other-requirements/responsible-conduct-of-research-rcr/
I think itâ€™s a bunch of Canvas quizzes. It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t take long. Please do it ASAP.</description></item><item><title>Interpretting Embeddings With Comparison</title><link>/talks/2021_10_china_embeddings/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/talks/2021_10_china_embeddings/</guid><description>Invited Keynote at the CSIG-VIS International Lecture Series (China, virtual).

I get many requests from students from my classes to provide reference (recommendation) letters for graduate school applications. I will not provide these letters.
I will provide letters for students that I get to know outside of regular classes. For example, if you are involved in a directed study project or work with me as a peer mentor for a class (that&amp;rsquo;s why it says &amp;ldquo;as a student&amp;rdquo;).</description></item><item><title/><link>/lunr-search/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/lunr-search/</guid><description> Search Results Waiting for search script to run...</description></item><item><title>Undergrad Research, Projects and Directed Studies</title><link>/pages/advice/undergrad-research/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jun 2020 08:25:36 -0500</pubDate><guid>/pages/advice/undergrad-research/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you are currently an undergraduate and interested in getting involved in a project, please read this.

For example, we have developed methods for improving pictures and video as a post-process (e.g. removing shadows and stabilizing video). We have also worked on adapting imagery for use in new settings (e.g. image and video retargeting or automatic video editing) and making use of large image collections (e.g. intestingness detection or panorama finding).</description></item><item><title>Visualizing English Print</title><link>/researchtheme/vep/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jun 2020 18:49:37 -0500</pubDate><guid>/researchtheme/vep/</guid><description>To drive our data science efforts, we took a specific application: working with English literature scholars to develop approaches to working with large collections of historical texts.</description></item><item><title>Perceptual Principles for Visualization</title><link>/researchtheme/perceptprinc/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jun 2020 18:49:29 -0500</pubDate><guid>/researchtheme/perceptprinc/</guid><description>Understanding how people see can inform how we should design visualizations. We have been exploring how recent results in perception (e.g., ensemble encoding) can be exploited to create novel visualization designs, and how principles of perception can inform visualization designs.</description></item><item><title>Communicative Characters</title><link>/researchtheme/commchar/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jun 2020 18:49:13 -0500</pubDate><guid>/researchtheme/commchar/</guid><description>We are working on better ways to synthesize human motions to make animated characters (both on screen and robots) that are better able to communicate. Generally, we focus on trying to make use of collections of examples (such as motion capture) to build models that allow us to generate novel movements, or to define models of communicative motions.</description></item><item><title>Usable VR and AR</title><link>/researchtheme/usablearvr/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jun 2020 18:48:50 -0500</pubDate><guid>/researchtheme/usablearvr/</guid><description>Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) are interesting display devices that are becoming practical.

How do we build interaction tools that can help people construct and diagnose machine learning models?</description></item><item><title>Bad Page</title><link>/pages/bad-page/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 22:33:38 -0500</pubDate><guid>/pages/bad-page/</guid><description>This is a placeholder for old pages that did not get converted.</description></item><item><title>Communicating Physical Interactions</title><link>/researchtheme/commphysinteractions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/researchtheme/commphysinteractions/</guid><description>We are working on ways for people and robots to communicate to each other about how objects should be manipulated in the world. Manipulations necessarily involve physical interactions (e.g., forces must be applied correctly). We are exploring ways for people to tell robots how to act with appropriate forces (e.g., to teach manipulation skills) as well as for robots to communicate back to people about the actions they are performing.</description></item><item><title>Boxer: Interactive Comparison of Classifiers (Talk Video)</title><link>/video/2020_boxer_talk/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/video/2020_boxer_talk/</guid><description>This video was the &amp;ldquo;talk&amp;rdquo; for EuroVis 2020 that presented our paper Boxer: Interactive Comparison of Classifier Results.

This really was all in real-time on a circa 1996 Macintosh. I have no idea how I made it go so fast.
This video is from the 1997 Interactive 3D Symposium Paper. An earlier version of the paper actually appeared as a 1998 journal paper. The journal paper mainly has 2D examples, and focuses on the non-interactive cases.</description></item><item><title>Image Snapping</title><link>/video/1995_snapping/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 1995 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/video/1995_snapping/</guid><description/></item><item><title>A Differential Approach to Graphical Manipulation</title><link>/video/1994_thesis/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 1994 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/video/1994_thesis/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Through-the-Lens Camera Control</title><link>/video/1992_ttl/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 1992 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/video/1992_ttl/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Briar</title><link>/video/1991_briar/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 1991 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/video/1991_briar/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>/sectionlinks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/sectionlinks/</guid><description> Home Papers Talks Videos Advice</description></item><item><title>2009 Home Page</title><link>/pages/graveyard/2009-home/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/pages/graveyard/2009-home/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is an Ancient (2009) version of my home page.

Part of the problem is keeping track of what you&amp;rsquo;ve read. I strongly recommend that you keep a bibliography (database) of everything you read that is research/work related.
Update: back when I wrote this, there weren&amp;rsquo;t any good technological solutions to this. That has changed a bit. As of 2020, I am using Zotero. Medeley is in some ways a better alternative, but there are issues that the company that runs it treats your data in an unacceptable manner.</description></item><item><title>Bad Page Request</title><link>/badpage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/badpage/</guid><description>The URL that you were looking for was on my old web site.

At the time, it was way better than anything else. It inspired later techniques, notably our 2009 3D Warping technique, and our 2010 Subspace Warping technique (which evolved into the Adobe Warp Stabilizer.).
Re-Cinematography pushed the limits of what could be done with 2D global warps (using a single, 8 parameter projective warp over the entire image). The later techniques (e.g. SubSpace Video Stabilization (ToG 2011)) went beyond it by allowing for warping the image, not just global deformations.</description></item><item><title>Status Reports</title><link>/pages/advice/statusreports/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/pages/advice/statusreports/</guid><description>&lt;div id="wikitext">
