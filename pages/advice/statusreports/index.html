<p>If you work for me (for example, as an RA or an undergrad directed study) you must send me a status report every week.</p>
<p>I have found this to be a useful tool not just for the &ldquo;reviewer&rdquo;(e.g. me reading this), but also for the person writing it. I really believe if you spend 15 minutes doing this every week, you will be more productive in the long run.</p>
<p>One of the things that I have found over the years is that its quite easy to forget what you&rsquo;ve accomplished, forget what you were trying to do, forget to think about what you should be doing, &mldr; I, therefore, have found it really useful to write periodic reports that force me to think about these things, and leave a record so I can remember what I&rsquo;ve been doing. The form of this report is designed to foster that kind of thought, and to help identify problems that may crop up.</p>
<p>Your report should be sent to me by email on Friday of each week (if you choose to do it over the weekend, or on Monday morning, that&rsquo;s OK - but be consistent). Please send it with the title &ldquo;NAME&rsquo;s status report for 9/1/2005&rdquo; (important: make sure you have your name and the date in the report since I get a bunch of these). Be sure to save a copy for yourself (so at the end of a semester we can look back at them). Please send me the status report in the text of an email - not as an attachment.</p>
<p>Your report should have the following following 6 sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>What were my goals for this week?</li>
<li>What did I accomplish this week?</li>
<li>Why are numbers 1 and 2 different?</li>
<li>What are my goals for next week?</li>
<li>How does this fit in to my bigger picture? How does #4 fit into my longer term goals? (What are the longer term goals?) What deadlines are looming beyond the week horizon?</li>
<li>What did I read this week?</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally: If you are an hourly employee, please list the hours you worked. I&rsquo;m curious when you worked and what you did (at least roughly). If you are also doing directed study work, I am curious what you consider &ldquo;paid time&rdquo; versus what you consider part of directed study? I trust that people work when they say they worked, but it&rsquo;s useful for me to make sure people are working on the right things, and to understand how long various things take.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Status reports are to help understand how things are progressing. It is much better to file a status report saying that little got done than it is to wait until you have something you are proud of. File one every week - whether you accomplished anything or not.</p>
<h2 id=some-comments-on-these-questions>Some comments on these questions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The time management literature (especially the books by Covey and Allen) say that a week is the right size time chunk to do planning at: days are too &ldquo;micro&rdquo;, months are too long.</li>
<li>However, working along week by week, its way too easy to lose track of the big picture. The &ldquo;macro&rdquo; planning process is seperate from the weekly report. We should do semester scale planning as well, but that is independent of the weekly report.</li>
<li>Number 1 is not necessarily the previous weeks #4 - in practice, goals change over time.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s best to be honest about number 3 - it&rsquo;s a great place to identify roadblocks that come up.</li>
<li>Question #5 is designed to help reconnect to the big picture. I left it out initially from my suggested format. It&rsquo;s not meant to take the place of periodic long-term planning.</li>
<li>Question #6 is a new addition. It is added for a number of reasons. First, I had been concerned that many people get so caught up in hacking or the specific thing they are doing that they aren&rsquo;t reading - which is an important part of research. Second, I am not getting to read as much as I would like, so this is a way for me to hear about more stuff vicariously. For the purposes of the status report DON&rsquo;T PUT THE WHOLE CITATION. Just give me enough information so I have an idea of what it is. For example:</li>
</ul>
<pre>    Interactive Video Cutout, SIGGRAPH 2005 
</pre>
<dl><dd>Is totally sufficient.
</dd></dl>
<ul>
<li>Putting non-research stuff in 1-5 is a good idea. For exmaple, its good to know that you have an exam during the week so you might not get as much research work done, or that you didn&rsquo;t get enough work done on your class project because you&rsquo;re busy doing research. I&rsquo;m less interested in non-research related readings (#6) unless you feel that it is relevant.</li>
